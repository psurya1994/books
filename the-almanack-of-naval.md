Wealth:
- Making money is a skill you learn. 
	- Naval can make money in 5-10 years even if he lost all his money and was dropped in a random street. He developed the skills.
	- Work hard only after to figure out what to work on. 
	- You can't get rich if you're paid for your time. You can only get rich if you own equity (a piece of business).
	- Learn to "sell" and "build".
	- Build "specific knowledge": you feel it's play but others feel it's work (which can't be automated)
- Take responsibility and pick up high impact projects for your employer.
- Build your personal brand on youtube. that will land you far mote jobs than your prev workk ex.


Personal thoughts:
- What do I have, that society needs, that I can provide to it? What is my "specific knowledge" that comes as play to me but as work to most other people?
	- The puzzle of happiness. Our happiness is not scaling according to technology. This is a space in which I can uniquely contribute. I need to start off and refine it as things go alone.
