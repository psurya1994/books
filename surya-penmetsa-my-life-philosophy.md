What others think

Here are some facts about the world:
1. What others think is often a poor metric of how well you are living your life.
2. To desire good opinion of others, is to focus on something that is out of your control.
3. The masses are often not clear thinkers. They are confused about the world. They have different values than you do. 
4. Why do we care about what others think? Especially when these people are not who we hold in high esteem.
