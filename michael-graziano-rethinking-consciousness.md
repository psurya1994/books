### Chapter 1: Overview of claims

- Humans have machinery that impels us to attribute consciousness to various objects (eg. humans, puppets, animals, sometimes trees, etc.). This intuition is often wrong. It might depend on simplified but useful models. 

- The book introduces attention schema theory. It doesn't solve the hard problem of consciousness but why people think there is a hard problem and how it is advantegeous for functioning fo the brain. 

- Our brain builds simplified models of the world which anchors our intuitions. Attention schema is a particular internal model that can derive our intutions of the non-physical inner essence. The same model can be used to make predictions about others. 

- We are not conscious of all the information processing in our brain. We are conscious of a small amount of htat information. Something much happen to a limited amound of information to make us conscious of it. What makes it happen? How can something enter there? The author says his attention schema theory has an answer to all of these questions.
