This book talks about general ideas on how to have a good lasting marriage. Because I'm new to reading this book, I find it hard to judge how good the book is. While nothing was too surprising, I hope that reading this book has helped me internalize some of the ideas.

Do nice things:
- Be kind.
- Respect differences. There's no right thing. Have an open conversation and understand the other person's perspective. Agree to disagree.
- People have different styles of managing emotional intensity. Some people are closed, others are open -- embrace their way rather than wasting energy trying to change it. 
- Be thoughtful about how, when and what to say. When you're feeling intense emotion, it might not be the right time to talk to your partner. 
- Overtime, we fail to notice the positives and focus on the negatives (because that's how the brain is wired). Aim to have 5:1 positive to negative interations. Keep telling the person what they do well and the specific qualities they have. It could be with gestures too-- hand around their shoulder, smile, pat on the back, etc. 
- Do something nice everday for them: make coffee, cook dinner, go for a walk, etc.,

On praise:
- People always crave praise, give it to them. It also helps you realize and feel grateful about these things.
- Focus on what saves the relationship. Keep ego, and being right aside. Things to say during a fight: "I love you. This is stupid. Let's just drop it."
- If you treat someone as if she were already what she potentially could be, you make them that.
- Stick to your word. If you tell you'll clean the house by Sunday, do it. If you miss, be clear about it. Be quick to apologize, don't use medical terms as a cop out (ADHD, etc.,)
- No one can live happily if they feel more judged than admired. Dail down the criticism, dail up the appretiation. 
- If you want something to be a certain way (organized clothes), and the other person doesn't oblige, express it as it is. There are many people in the world who would be happy with a partner who doesn't oblige. 

On listening:
- Talk less, convey criticism succinctly. Maybe tell them how you felt about something, and let them ponder on it. 
- While problem solving together, focus on one issue at a time.
- If you partner expects criticism, replace it with praise. 
- If your partner doesn't follow your advice, it's a good indication that you shouldn't be giving it. Give advice only if the other person asks for it. For each advice you give, also take advice from your partner and focus on acting on it. Give them the space to make mistakes and learn from them.
- If it's an important issue, keep all distractions aside and give her full attention.
- Don't switch to problem solving mode when the other person complains. Atleast for conversation 1, just listen and ask questions (unless they ask advice). You can brainstorm on solutions during the second. 
- Invite your spouse for criticism and listen actively. This defuses them. Challenge yourself to hear it fully. Ask "is there more you haven't told me?"
- Be okay to cut the conversation "let's talk some other time when we're feeling calmer"
- Don't be defensive. Use mindfulness to defuse it. 

Connecting with distance:
- Identify who is the pursuer and who is the distancer.
- If your partner is a private person, give them space.
- Have technology free time. 
- Pursue your goals, not your partner. (for pursuer)
- Distancing can make things worse, so treat your partner as a very close friend and be available for them. 

Fight fair:
- Makes rules that you follow in the heat of the moment: no yelling or name calling, no bringing up problems during bedtime, etc.
- Use humor to deescalade conflict.

Children:
- Don't ask "what did you learn at school today?", instead ask "did you ask a good question today?"



Phrasese to use:
- I'm so sorry that you're having to deal with this, and I want you to know that I'm here for you.
- It's not easy to hear what you're telling me, but I want you to know that I will give it a lot of thought. 


Ideas I read from other places:
- Take responsibility. Do 80% of the work at home. (Jocko Willink)
- If the emotions are running high, say "can we setup a meeting on Friday evening so that I can give you my full attention?"
- Ask for feedback: "what are somethings I can improve on?" "I think I can do better on the following things, what do you think?". Do biweekly introspection sessions, just like the ones I do by myself. 
- Treat your spouse like a child. Talk to her like you would to a child.
- Commit to your partner fully, don't tiptoe on the edge. 
- Think clearly about the compromises your partner is making to be in this relationship. Think clearly about who holds more power. 
- Use ideas from NVC. "When you do X, the story that I tell myself is that (Y)"
- Just like with kids, don't create a rulebook of what they should and shouldn't do. Let them do their thing, and give feedback when they mess up.
