Summary:
Even though people say an ambient level of anxiety and stress is good because it motivates us, the author disagrees. And he suggests ways to reduce anxiety based on science and his clinical experience. The same ideas are applicable for procrastination too. The key idea is to do habit loops mindfully so that we can change the reward values for specific behaviors in the OFC. This is a very interesting idea that I haven't read about before. The book has reiterated the importance of mindfulness and I'm excited to pursue it with double the enthusiasm now.

The gears analogy:
- Gear 0: Recognize that you're anxious / stressed
- Gear 1: Map out your habit loops
- Gear 2: Bring careful non-judgemental awareness to the results of the habit loop. (rewire your reward value)
- Gear 3: Find behaviors with bigger action values. Especially, something that's internal and doesn't feed a different habit loop (mindfulness). 

Introduction:
- Anxiety used to hide in bad habits before, but now many people know it. 
- Learning to get anxious is a habit. To deal with anxiety, people stress eat, drink alcohol and procrastinate. 

Chapter 1: Introduction
- Being able to recognize that you have anxiety is the first step.
- Having anxiety comes along with cascading health issues even if you're eating healthy and exerising everyday.
- 30% people say they had some form of anxiety disorder. 20% say they had it in the last year. 
- Study: there's more anxiety in high income countries than low. 
- There's correlation between higher levels of anxiety and having more alcohol.

Chapter 2:  
- When we can't accurately predict future, PFC runs out simulations of possible futures. 
- Learning from experience is much more effective than learning things as concepts. 
- Anxiety is socially contagious.
- It's not possible to think or reason out of anxiety. Your PFC is shut down when you're feeling very anxious. 
- You can use reasoning to short circuit the bad thinking loop before it occurs. 

Chapter 3:
- We're all addicted. Addiction: "continued use despite adverse consequences"
- If you're getting something easy (within two clicks on the internet-- shopping, ordering food, social media, etc.,) and intermittently (notifications, likes, etc.), you're more likely to be addicted. We have drugs in every direction that are trying to get us to hooked onto them. Everything around you is designed by big companies to be maximally addictive. 
- Your smartphone is nothing but an advertising billboard in your body. This is dangerous. 

Chapter 4:
- Anxiety is an itch that makes us take an action. Anxiety triggers worry triggers distraction.
- The problem with checking your phone or ordering food when you're anxious is that this only reinforces new bad habits. 
	- It makes you more vulnerable to doing this each time you're worried. 
	- The distraction wears off, and you'll have to look for new distractions.
- Even when we know worrying doesn't solve anything, the old brain continues to trigger worry.
- Judson's research shows that mindfulness can be incredibly effective. 
- People thinking anxiety is the "appropriate feeling" is counter productive. 

Chapter 5:
- The ideas here that we will learn for anxiety can also be applied for procrastination.
- Map out your habit loops: not sure what to do in the evening -> watch youtube -> losing the discomfort of feeling bored (trigger -> behavior -> result / reward). Just recognizing this, and seeing how that explains our behavior can be enlightening. 
- Focus on understanding the loops both intellectually and experiencially before trying to fix it. 

Chapter 6:
- Habits: old brain. Conscious thinking and will power: new brain. 
- Strategies that don't work (for anxiety):
	- Will power: just telling yourself that anxiety is brain playing games and that it doesn't matter won't help. never works in long term (unless you offload things as habits to the old brain).
	- Substitution: replace the behavior with something more healthy. But you'll vulnerable to falling back. The action of watching puppy pictures instead of smoking when you're anxious won't work in the long term because the rewards that puppies serve over time will decrease. 
	- Environmental setup: works for a while, but it's easy to fall back into the lod habit loop.
	- Mindfulness: being aware and curious about experience helps. 
- "Don't just do something, sit there."
- Suggesting people fixes without listening to them deeply doesn't help. People are only receptive to your suggestions once they feel that you understood them properly.

Chapter 7:
- Recognizing habit loop and just telling people to stop doing it never works. 
- Isn't anxiety helpful? Brain makes associations. People have experiences where they were anxious and that helped them meet a deadline. They use this as evidence that anxiety helps performance even though there was no evidence of causality. 
- People wear anxiety / stress as a badge of honor. They talk as if they are necessary parts of being successful. 
- Even researches have argued that a little anxiety is critical to perform optimally. But only a 4% of papers suggest that; 46% of the papers have a clear negative curve: more aniety / stress lead to lesser performance. 
- Explore your own relation to anxiety: is anxiety always good? were there times where you performed without anxiety? does anxiety suck your energy? 
- To change habit loops, you need to change rewards, not the triggers. 

Chapter 8:
- Mindfulness helps us be aware of the habit loops. 
- The goal of meditation is not to empty your mind. Or does it free you of anxiety. It just changes our relationship to them. We don't identify with them.
- The default mode network is what is triggered when your mind is wandering without knowing that it's lost in thought. We generally default to thoughts that are related to us.
- DMB gets triggers when we're in thought loops. PCC (a part of DMN) gets triggered when thinking about addictions (especially when we're craving and repeatedly thinking about it). When we're shown image of triggers. 
- Anxious people perseverate (think in loops) about future, depressed people perseverate about past. Once we are in these loops enough times, they feel more familiar and safe and become habits. Mindfulness helps us dismantle the process of perseveration. 
- DMN is much quieter in experienced meditators. PCC is less active in people who learn to quit smoking using mindfulness. 

Chapter 9:
- People have different personalities on what motivates them. People who approach do well with positive reinforcement and people who avoid do well with negative reinforcement. 
- Scores on test: 33, 19, 26. So I'm of the avoid type. This is my mindfulness personality type. So, I need to be careful of not being over critical about myself. 

Part 2:
- Updating the brain's reward structure
	- let the pain visit
	- allow it to teach you
	- don't allow it to overstay

Chapter 10:
- The more the reward, the more likely it is to be a habit.
- OFC remembers the value of various behaviors. It sets the rewarrd value and forgets the details.
- To change behavior, change the reward value in OFC. It can be done by being more mindful about the consequences of the habit. 
- The value of the behavior only changes if we do it mindfully instead of in the autopilot mode.
- If we're mindful about an unproductive habit, the value for it will inevitably reduce in the OFC. So next time you're watching the TV or distracted on the internet, pay attention to how you feel. You actually feel like shit. Feel it as closely as possible. Realize that's it's not rewarding and you're less likely to do it in future.
- Same with worry. Be mindful to realize that worrying doesn't help. 
- Once your OFC reward is updated, you don't have to use will power to change habits anymore. 
- Step 1: what are my habit loops, step 2: be mindful about what you're getting from the behavior. 

Chapter 11:
- Step 2 is incredibly effective for Jud's clients. Apply this repeatedly during the day to rewire the reward values for various behaviors. 
- To change behaviors more quickly, do more repetitions each day. For example, workout for 3 times each day; with awareness and writing down the habit loops. 

Chapter 12: 
- Don't try to think yourself out of the behavior and feel bad when you lapse. Just do the lapses mindfully which rewires the reward in OFC.
- Step 3: active self reflection on giving into the behavior, without getting sucked into it. (retrospective second step) Basically step 2 using visualization instead of giving into the desire. Step 2 needs to be done without judgement. 
- We can also build specific mindsets using reward-based learning. People have two types of mindsets: fixed and growth. It depends on what you think intelligence is based on. fixed tend to dread failure where as growth embrace it. 
- The best gift parents give children is to learn to embrace challenges and failure. 
- Doing step 2 without judgment relates to the growth mindset. It feels good and makes accomplishing your goals easier. 
- See all failures as a learning experience, and as a step forward. 

Chapter 13:
- PCC was activated when both craving chocolate and aversion for chocolate.
- We often don't enjoy food as much after eating 50%, you need to train your mind to see this to rewire the value of orders lots of food when you're hungry. This awareness also generally helps overeating. Same applies for over thinking. 
- Attitude matters. Taking out the trash or cooking, if you do it with a bad attitude, you associate it with negative reward. If you do it with a good attitude as if it were no big deal, that increases the value of it. 
- Be curious and track values for your behaviors. 

Chapter 14: 
- How long does it take to build new habits? The 21 day theory doesn't work. Jud's lab used the rescola wagner model for modeling this. V(t+1) = V(t) + lr * \delta(t). His data suggests that the reward value drops to 0 after 10-15 mindful trials. 
- We need to update the value of eating something throughout the meal. The problem is that we do that only for the first bite. 
- Don't trust your thoughts. Trust your experience: the sensations and feelings.
- "Regret and review" is an unhealthy and ineffective way to change behavior. "Look and learn" without judgment is a better way.

Part 3:
- Curiosity will conquer fear better than bravery.

Chapter 15:
- Even if we know something is bad, it's hard to change that behavior. We can't use reason and will power alone to get out of it. 
- The reason why we have less self control when we're stressed is because cognitive control area (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) is the first to go offline. 
- Will power: this is bad, stop right now (active fight between old and new brain). Mindfulness: continue doing it, but do it mindfully (rewires the reward value of the old brain)
- The OFC estimates values for different behaviors to free up cognitive load.
So to replace old behaviors, you'll have to find a better behavior which has higher value. If you don't, it's going to be a war between old habit and being idle. 
- Being mindful of the craving can be that replacing behavior (BBO: bigger better offer). 
- The problem with replacing the behavior with watching instagram videos of cute puppies is that our brain tolerence for it increases. And we'll need cuter and cuter puppies to get the same reward. 
- Use awareness to get out of that feeling that you need to do soemthing. 

Chapter 16: The Science of Curiosity
- Curiosity: a strong desire to know or learning something. We need to tap out inner curiosity potential.
- Two flavors of curisity: I-curiosity (interest) and D-curiosity (deprivation). 
- IC: just genuinely interested.
	- learning about a new scientific idea, reading a book.
	- open
	- the process of seeking info feels good
	- this is sustainable and doesn't taper off. 
- DC: the itch that must be scratched. 
	- when you see that you got a message but not the content
	- when you forget an piece of information you wanted to talk about
	- to know how much you have to wait for the next bus
	- closed
	- info feels good, while the process doesn't
- IC is more about the journey where as DC is more about the destination. 
- We have a reward for curiosity in the OFC. 
- Reframe anxiety and procrastination as opportunities to quench your IC. 
- When something doesn't work, respond with "hmm" instead of judging yourself. It is hard to take yourself too seriously when you're "hmm"ing all day long.
- "Hmm" can destroy the negative feedback loop of anxiety. 

Chapter 17:
- Don't take habits as identities. If someone says, "I don't like waking up in the morning", it's because they identify themself with the behavior. Just be aware of this process with curiosity and no judgment. 
- Curiosity in itself is good. It pulls you in. 
- Use breathing as a way to recognize and step out of habit loops. Breathing is a great third gear BBO. Just focusing on your breath with open curiosity can be as interesting as anything else you do in life.

Chapter 18: 
- Kids break rules that they think are dumb. They haven't learned from experience. 
- RAIN
	- recognize
	- accept: allow it to be there
	- investiagte: emotions, thoughts and senstations
	- note: observe what's happening moment to moment.

Chapter 19: All you need is love
- Metta practice. Genuine well wishing for ourselves and others. Kindness feels good and reduces PCC activity. 
- Using it on people who make you angry can be especially effective. Just a minute of well wishing for both him and yourself. 

Chapter 20: why habit loop
- Anxiety drains energy. 
- People think if they can just figure out "why" they're anxious, that it will magically fix their anxiety. And get more anxious they there's no good reason. 
	- what if the why doesn't matter? what if the only thing that matters is how you respond to it?
	- each time you see a why habit loop developing, take three deep breaths and say to yourself "why doesn't matter"
	- the why loop drains energy, focus on what it feels like instead 
- Changing your facial expression and trigger the curiosity mode instead of stress mode. Open your eye wide and losen facial muscles with a slight smile to be in the best mood for curious awareness. 

Chapter 21: 
- Focus on switching between gears effectively. No gear is better than the other. 
- Noting meditation practice:
	- recognize which sensation is most dominent in each moment: the five senses, thinking and feeling. 
	- this keep you in the present moment without falling into autopilot. 
	- noting gets easier over time, do it mutliple times during the day
- Noting practice could defuse Jud's panic attack experience quite effectively. 
- Register third gear by using the second gear technique.

Chapter 22:
- Learn from your own experience, build your own data. Don't just trust Jud's ideas. 
- Also use mindfulness to figure out how to setup your environment optimally. For jud, for writing a paper, it was: interest + knowledge + experience = enjoying writing + good product = flow.
- To write papers quickly, it is so much easier if you've been thinking a lot about the topic before and have a lot of knowledge. Jud wrote a paper in one morning in just three hours. 
	- In my case, I'm doing the right thing by reading a lot. As I become more knowledgable on these topics, it will be much easier for me to make a lot of content. 
- Jud furthered this idea by taking a two day retreat at home to write the book The Craving Mind. He did it! Process: sit, walk, write, repeat (and write only when in flow). do nothing else except primary tasks. At the first sign of discomfort, he got back to meditation. 
- Jud did the same next year, he wrote this book in just 7 days! The inital three days of the retreat, he didn't feel like writing, so he just sat down and meditated until the feeling went away. 
- My thoughts on this section:
	- I find these ideas where he was able to complete full books without procrastination incredibly inspiring. I want to do the same in my case: build knowledge and experience in my areas of work so that I will be able to write books with ease once I'm 50 years old. 

Chapter 23:
- Take it a few minutes at a time. Don't look too far ahead. Try to stay 5 minutes, 1 hour, one evening, or one day without anxiety / procrastination. Don't think too far ahead in the future. 
- Yes, the past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, but the only thing that can affect this is what we do in the present moment. 
- Kindness beats meanness, everytime. Just being aware, you can rewire the reward function of being mean, that it just makes things worse for all parties are involved. 



My thoughts:
- Some people say worrying help me take action. But that's not good. If you need to worry each time to drive yourself to take action, you cannot have a happy life. And it also makes you vulnerable to long term depression. Anxiety triggers worry. Worrying never helps. 
- If you want to offer advice when someone shares a bad experience, first steelman their experience so that they feel deeply understood and would be more receptive to what you say.
