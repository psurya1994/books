	- production blocking
- but collaboration is important: writers block can be avoided by sitting in a cafe, we need to have extra quite time for introverts to produce their best work.

Chapter 4: nature or nurture?
- study: it's genetic. infants to react to small stimulus when they're young are more likely to be introverts when they're older. same stimulus moves introverts more. 
- it's 40-50% genetic.
- introvert empathize better, and feel more guilty when they hurt others.

- extroverts who socialize more and don't study -- suffer.
- people who can talk well impromptu are extroverts, they can do this because their brain works differently. introverts can write better reports.
- theory: humans chase the right level of stimulation, not too much, not too little

Chapter 5:

- introverts adn extrovert needs different levels of stimulation to perform optimally in life.
- introverts are aroused by lower sounds (measure by heart rates); when introverts are forced to used exrtroverts sound levels, their performance deteriorates.
- pick environemnts that are "optimal levels of arousal" -> that works best for you.
- spend as much time as possible in this sweet spot to perform at your best.
- introverts can't perform optimally in public settings because they are outside of their sweet spot of arousal
- There are psychological limits on how we act. (if you socialize in the morning, you won't have energy to deliver talk in the afternoon)

- extroverts have more pleasure when they gain something. they feel more pleasure. 
- extroverts dopamine reacts more to win. the brain lights up when they win. they get too excited.

- study: introverts slow down when they make mistakes, where as extroverts speed up. this is good for introverts, they learn more.
- Study: introverts predict college performance more than cognitive ability
- introverts are more patient, when alone they spend more time wondering about things. extroverts focus more on their environment.
- Persistence based tasks are much better for introverts. 
- introvertion vs extroversion doesn't predict performance on sales calls, because introverts are calm and lsitening more; extrovert speak well, but might be distracted. 
- we, in the world, don't value the importance of introversion; it's a key skill if you want to learn quick and perform well.
- flow happens when you become independent of your environment, and not respond to it's rewards and punishments. it's more of a introvert quality; it's easier for introvert to get into this state because they're already robust to distractions in their environemnt.
- Suggestions for introverts: trust your gut, stay true to your nature. work slowly on the things htat you enjoyum don't let other people make you feel that you ned to race. being unmoved by rewards is a super power, use it to become your best self. 
- introvert need to trust their gut and share their ideas more extensively. don't let the world be filled with what the extroverts have to say. honor your style.
- Don't be swayed by a person's extroversion as a sign of smartness, most people make htat mistkae, be on gaurd so that you don't make it.
- warren buffet was an introvert and focused on persistence and learning, and not being swayed by the crowds. he was anxious of public speaking until he took the dale carnagie course.
- Part of asians > whites for education can be explained by them being more introverted. 
	- the dad's job is to program and the kids job is to study
	- they prioritize studies over playing football
	- introversion is actually seen as good
	- teach your kid that quite learning is okay.
- asia is introverted, europe is extriverted, US is over extroverted
- it's better to be quite than talk - Lao Tzu
- the cultural differences can be seen in the quotes that these place appretiate.
- Asain's are seen a full unit, and ready to compromise for the greater good. US see itself as individuals and hence act in their own itnerests.
- Asian's are polite, straightforwardness seems rude to them.
- Gandhi's an introvert, wasn't able to communicate well unless he writes. Restraint was one of his greatest assests, he picked his battled carefully. 
- Quality: "quiet persistence" -- determines excellence. Being quite helps a lot when you want to learn. Quiet people are better as they spend more time learning than talking. They can be more persistent in the things that they do. 

Chapter 9: when should you act being an extrovert
- Prof. Brain Little who would the nobel prize of university teaching: someone who can seem like an extrovert while teaching is an introvert, and likes spending a lot of quite time. 
	- He's so introverted that he could fall ill if he's forced to spend too much time outside (or in a situation involving conflict).
	- Understanding his limits (if you socialize in the morning, you won't have energy to deliver talk in the afternoon), he took every chance to avoid it.
- Person-situation debate
	- a person can be inherently introverted
	- no, it depends on the situation. a person is introverted only in situation X, Y, and Z. he won't be introverted in other situations. these social masks themselves are our true selfs.
- How do you as an introvert decide if you have to push yourself to be an extrovert or stay true to yourself? Or how do you decide which combination of the two you need to take? Brain Little tells us that:
	- Free trait theory: we have a core personality trait, and we can out of character in service of "core personal projects" (eg. throw extroverted wife a surprise party)
	- So it's okay to take up new personalities when we're fulfiling these core projects.
- But can we really act out of character like this?
	- Yes, and you can get better at it once you start pretending. You can do that by getting better at "self-monitoring": ability to change your behavior based on social cues.
- If we can, should we?
	- Doing it a little is good, over-doing is disastrous. 
	- Doing is for a project you care about is less draining. Doing is for a limited time is less draining.

- So find your true values, see what things you naturally inclined towards, see who you envy (that's an indicator of what you value)
- Find jobs that give you the flexibility and time to do restorative activities such as writing. Find job that has less meetings, and private enough space where you can work in. Is the job flexible enough?
- Find jobs where you can stay in your natural self most of the time.
- Make a free trait agreement to people close to you: we'll act out of character some of hte time, in exchange for being ourselves rest of the time. 
	- wife vs husband: make an agreement -- hald the time we go out, half the time we stay home
	- make it with your boss, telling him that thats when you do your best work so that you can work from home 2 days a week
- Doing can help you be better than extroverts when you're going out of your personality because you have the advantages of being better prepared than extroverts.
- Staying out of character for too long is responsible for stress and depression. And it speeds aging.

Chapter 10: how to talk to extroverts
- Having different personalities can match togeter: one listens while otehr talks, etc. But it can also cause conflict.
- In society, it's seen as if introverts are anti-social and extroverts are pro-social. That's not true, they're just differently social. 
- Extrovert makes you a better at having higher number of friends, but not necessarily of higher quality.
- It's hard for extroverts to understand how badly introverts need to recharge at the end of hte day. 
- Barack and Michelle has the same issue: Barack was okay just working on his own in the evenings, but it made michelle feel lonely. 
- Introverts are agreeable, where are extroverts don't mind conflict. 
- Extroverts have an inherent preference towards people they compete with. 
- For introverts, it's important to collaborate with aggreable people. For extroverts, they don't mind what type of collaboration they have. 
- It always better to negotiate politely with a partner than aggresively. Instead of "you're anti-social", say "can we find a way to organize our weekends in a way that works for us both?"
- It's okay to hiss when the other person gets aggresive: "that's not okay with me"
- Introverts are good at decoding people's emotions when they're observing, but not when they are actively participating. Because their nervous system is already on overdrive.
- Introverts like talking about a few things more deeply. Extroverts prefer talking about a wider range of things quitely. 

Chapter 11: how to cultivate quite kids
- Extroverted parents feel that something might be wrong with the introverted kid because he doesn't socialize that much.
- Listen to your kids. Understand why they behave in specific ways, and strategize together.
- If they're nervous, tell that it's normal and it will get easier over time. 
- Do incremental exposure to socialization, not all at once.
- Give positive feedback each time they do something well.
- Make sure his early experience with socialization is good.
- Let him get better at whatever he enjoys.

Summary:
- Don't worry about socializing with everyone, and prefer quality over quantity. 
- Put yourself in the optimal level of stimulus for your performance.
- Use your powers -- persistence, concentration, insight, sensitivity to do the work you love and matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply.
- See how you can contribute best to the thing you value, and if it means you need to act extrovert, do it for limited periods of time. 
- Do a job that suits your personality better, so that you don't burn out. 
- It's okay to miss social events and stay home when you don't feel like it. 
- Respect your loved one's need for socializing and your own for solitude.
- Spend time the way you like, not how others want you to. 
- Introverts enjoy being in their own imagined world solving problems.



Personal thoughts:
- I think I'm able to be the person I am because of my introversion, not despite. I wouldn't have been able to read as much, if I cared a lot about traveling or socializing.
