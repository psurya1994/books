Introduction
- This book by Tony Fadell, is the advice that he gives to CEOs, executives, interns, etc., who are making their way through teh business world.

1.1: Build Yourself
- The only way to learn in the real world is to fail. 
- If you want to start a career, the place to start would be "what do I want to learn?" Focus on learning early, take risks in the kinds of companies you join. Remember that many of the companies you start will fail.
- While joining, make sure you join a team of smart people who have build hard things before.
- If you're not feeling butterfiles regarding the things you're doing, you're not pushing yourself enough. 
- It's important to do the management analysis before writing a line of code.

1.2: Get a job
- If you're going to throw all your energy in, work for a company that's revolutionalizing something; not incremental changes.
- It is important to "solve a real world problem / pain point", if you want your product to be used. People won't buy it just because it's cool. The product you build needs to be of it's time. (eg. google glass, magic leap, etc.)
- You need to know every step of the process to become truly valuable to the team at your company. 

1.3: Heros
- Chase the humble rock stars of your field: they will lead you to the career you want. Focus on working with the best in your field.
- All you need to convince these kinds of people to hire you: "Spend a lot of time building things from the group up + reading a lot about everything happening in the industry; that will set you apart"
- It's possible to beome the most knowledgable for anyone, just read.
- Spend time finding the people who build things at revolutionary companies, and send them messages, share your thoughts / reports with them, etc. Keep sending them constant messages, even though they don't respond. They will recognize you at some point.
- If you're working at a big company, always focus on the getting the big picture; don't put all your energy into just building your slice of the banana.
- Heros have a lot of blind spots. You can get your knowledge in, help them understand their blind spots and build a good relationship.

1.4: don't (only) look down
- individual contributors generally focus on the things that need to be delivered soon. their responsiblity is to keep the details in check, so that the management can take higher level decisions.
- But if ICs do just this, they will run into a brick wall and have no learning.
- As an IC, you need to do two things: 
	- Look up: beyond the immediate dealine, but the long term goals. ensure that the direction makes sense to you. 
	- Look around: get out of your comfort zone of your team, go around talk to other teams and understand their concerns. helps you get more perspective on your project.
- You need to think like your manager. Make sure it feels right to you. It's the first step to making progress in that direction.
- The big picture helps you think more clearly about your specific role in the team.

2.1: Managing
- things to keep in mind for being a manager:
	- you don't have to be a manager to be successful
	- once you're manager, you'll stop doing the thing that made you successful
	- you'll need to spend time learning new skills
	- being demanding with great work is not micromanagement
	- any management style works: as long as you can comfortably share the hard truth with the team
	- don't worry that your team will outshine you
- try to understand why the marketing team is getting 2-3x budget than the engineering team
- trust your team, don't focus on getting things done your way. give them the task and make sure they meet it.
- get another guy who can replace you, and that will make your climb up the ladder easier.

2.2: data vs opinion
- sometimes, when there is not data, we will have to go by our opinion. 
- when there's data, everyone agrees on what to do
- getting data takes time. you need to test more carefully, it takes time and effort. you need to make clear hypothesis.
