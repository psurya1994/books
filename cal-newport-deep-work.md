## Deep work by Cal Newport

### Summary

The book talks about the importance of doing distraction free work with tips on how you can get there. This book is one of my favourites, that I keep coming back to. 


### The importance of deep work 

- Deep work: Activity performed in a state of distraction free focus. The state of mental strain that accomplishes deep work is necessary to improve your abilities. Spend enough time in the state of shallowness and you will permanently lose your capacity for deep work. Deep work will be the super power of the 21st century.

- To succeed, you should (i) produce your absolute best work, (ii) be able to learn new skills quickly. Deep work is not only essential but also sufficient for both of these (for most skills). To learn requires intense concentration. 

- With AI taking over, most people will suffer and some people will thrive. (a) highly skilled workers (ML, AI), (b) superstars (best in the world), (c) owners. To get into (a) or (b), you need deep work. 

- In future, there's won't be full time hiring, instead the best in the world will be consulted to complete projects. There will be an online market to hire these people, and most projects will go to the best person (no one likes second best). Best person can serve more people because work is remote. Affects consulting, marketing, writing, design, etc. (creating a good online profile from now on is very important, get on it quicker than others!)

- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that needs to be gained. 

## Evidence that deep work is necessary

- Performance psychology: study of what seperates experts from rest. Anders Ericsson's deliberate practice (is what seperates the experts): (i) focus your attention on the skill you want to improve, (ii) receive feedback consistently to keep your attention on where it's most productive. 

- Neuroscience evidence: Skills boil down to brain circuits: you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around relevant neurons. With intense focus on a specific skill, you force the specific relevant circuit to fire again and again in isolation. With low concentraion, you're allowing too many circuits to fire simultaneously.  

- `highQualityProducedWork = timeSpent x intensityOfFocus` Best students understand the role of intensity, they go out of their way to maximize concentration.

- Attention Residue: when you switch tasks, residue of the previous task remains. Shown to lead to poor performance. Email, notifications lead to residue. Even if it's as small as phone going off in the background, you lose focus. 

- Exceptions: Jack Dorsey: 40+ meetings in a day, anyone can walk in and talk. Thrives without depth, his subordinates do the deep work and he only takes the final decision.

### The default is not deep work

- Companies are embracing open officies, quick response to messages, etc. Why are they failing to see this? (i) impact is not measurable, (ii) principle of least resistance. (ii), protected from scrutiny by (i), supports such work culture. Leslie's experiments show that so much communication makes things worse (4 day work week increases productivity, less email communication increases productivity, etc.). 

- People tend to more communication because: (i) makes life easier, you don't need to plan in advance, you can be less organised, (ii) email helps you have the illusion of productivity. Without email, you're forced to plan what you should be working on and for how long. And busyness is often used as a proxy for productivity. A more relevant question to ask can be, "what did I do today, that wasn't there yesterday"

### Deep work is meaningful

- Deep work can generate a lot of satisfaction. Deep life is not just economically lucarative, but also a life well lived. MC: "Best moments in life occur when our body is stretched to it's limist in a voluntary effort to accomplish somethign difficult and worthwhile."

- Skillful management of attention is the key to a good life. Checking emails isn't rewarding (most emails are pointless) but being in the state of flow is inherently rewarding. 

- Flow make people happier than relaxation. More experiences of flow lead to a higher life satisfaction. To build your working life around the experience of flow / deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. 

- In this age of nihilism, craftmanship is what gives us divine meaning. See your work as your craft and doing it deeply as your purpose. And look at deep work as a religious ritual. 

- People fight desires (to watch TV, email, surfing web). These desires generally pop up into our mind when we're bored doing a hard task. Succumbing to it is a recepie for dissatisfaction. So, recognize it and use your skills of meditation to refocus on what's most important. 

- You have a finite amount of will power which depletes each time to fight a desire. Thinking about working out or not is generally less pressurable than the acitivty itself, the thought process is what makes us suffer more than the activity itself. And this suffering takes a toll on our will power. So, don't imagine yourself doing the activity, just stay in the moment and take it one step at a time.

- Transisioning from shallow to deep work is hard. Example: 9.30 - 10.00 am -> shallow browsing, 10.00am -> work. Sitting idle, or meditating prior to the deep work session makes it easier. Minimizing residue from previous shallow tasks is the key. 

### Strategy: Plan deep work

- Add routines / rituals to your working life so as to minimize the amount of will power needed to transision into deep work. 

- Decide on your depth philosphy: (i) monastic: isolate yourself completely from distractions, (ii) bimodal: definied stretches (of min. 1 day) of deep work and everything else (eg. Adam Grant, Carl Jung), (iii) rhythmic (same time everyday), (iv) journalistic (without schedule).

- A combination of (ii) and (iii) works best for me. Here's what I need to do: (for example, see Sept 2020 last week calendar)
	- Use (i) for the comlpetely unimportant distractions that take up my time. I will do this for cricket, by not following it for extended periods of time. 
	- As suggested by (ii), I need to have 2 stretches of 2 days of deep work every week. On these days, I minimize all distractions. I put all urges on a distraction sheet at attend to them at the end of the day.
	- As suggested by (iii), I will have 6 hours of work where I have 0-distractions everyday. (3 hours in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon)
	- I will spend rest of the day working on side projects that I enjoy, in a slow manner. For example, podcast, reading and writing. 

- People using their minds or valuable things are rarely haphazard. Plan things better; be clean and organized with objects in the room. (I need to get better at this in both digital and living spaces)

- Think like an artist and work like an accountant. Top artists never look for inspiration, just start doing it and stick with it irrespective of inspiration or boredom.

- Build rituals to the same level of strictness as previous thinkers. Minimize the friction to go deep by preplanning things:
	- where to work and for how long (needs to be an empty room used only for depth, have a fixed time frame, open-ended slog is horrible)
	- how you'll work once work starts (no internet, distraction sheet, having a plan and a metric for deep work (eg. how many pages you read), in pomodoros)
	- how you'll support your work (coffee and access to food, walks in nature in between)

### Strategy: Value deep work religiously

- To work deeply is what helps you reach virtue (as suggested in Stoicism). Treat this work as a religious ritual, as a holy thing. Don't take it lightly. Don't let other people interrupt you. 

- With a radical change in your environment, with a singnificant investment of money or effort, all dedicated towards supporting a deep task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. 

- Make grand gestures: JK Rowling checks into a 1000$/day hotel to write. Bill Gates chose week long retreat instead of seattle head quaters, Alan Lightman goes to a tiny island for 2.5 motnhs without internet or phone, Michael Pollan and Dan Pink built expensive writing cabins, Peter Shankman wrote his book flying business class, William Shockley didn't emerge from his room until he ironed out details for better transistor design.

### Strategy: working with others

- To take your work to the next level, you need to collaborate with others. Many ideas originate from open ended discussions with people. So, expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter. 

- To make it better, make the spoke collaborative. This is what Walter Brattain (experimentalist) and John Bardeen (theorist) did. WB creates experimnets ot exploit JB's theory; JB tries to expand his theory to meet WB's experiments. 

- Presence of another party waiting for your next insight can short circuire your natural instinct to avoid depth. (So, maybe I could book meetings with deep thinkers to throw some ideas at them. Maybe I can books more meetings with colleagues to do science)

- Guidelines for depth: (i) distraction destroys depth, (ii) work with someone inside your spoke on the same problem so that you can push each other.

### Strategy: Executing like a business

- This is inspired fomr Clayton Christensen's 4 disciplines of execution.

- #1: Focus on widly important
	- Focus on small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue in deep work hours.
	- Have a specific goal that will have tangible and substantial professional benefits.
	- Don't say no to trivial distractions, say yes to a subject that general terrigying longing that crowds everything else. (David Brooks, The Art of Focus)

- #2: Act on lead meausres
	- Lag measure: the things you're trying ot improve. Lead measure: the thing that will drive success on lag measure.
	- Example: Lead measure - time spend in a state of deep work towards your widly important goal. Lag meassure - number of papers published.

- #3: Keep a scorecard
	- People play differently when they're keeping a score (especially when it's public). 
	- Keep a scorecard where it can't be ignored. Circle when an important milestone is reached.

- #4: Create a Cadence of accountability
	- Do weekly review and plan for the week agead.
	- Celebrate good weeks. Understand what led to bad weeks. Figure out how to ensure good score for the days ahead. 

- Cal Newport's experience: (i) set goal to publish 5 papers in an year (ambitious), (ii) his tenure was looming (rewarding). Ended up publishing 9. 4DX kept him focused all year long. Regularity of work increased. 4DX: with the clarity of goal, and unavoidable feedback of lead measure -- he could go very deep.

### Strategy: Liesure and shutdown

- Tim Kreider (author of we learn nothing): hated frantic work, fled to "undisclosed location" to escape shallow obligations. Reason: it made him better at his job. He had to cycle for a while if he needed to get access to the internet for checking his email. Learn more on Tim Ferris's podcast #68; it's incredible.

- Idleness is to the brain what vitaminD is to the body. You need it to get any work done. The mind needs leisure.

- More time you spend doing shallow work, the more you accomplish. It is very different for deep work. Working more hours doesn't help you get more done, you need to puntuate with rest.

- Ideas for leisure: (i) retreat to undisclosed location, (ii) end of workday shut everything down and don't think about work. If you need more time, extend your workday but shut everything down once you're home. 

- Why shutdown? #1: Downtime aids insights
	- Study: continous conscious delibration is not helpful. You let your subcouncious (diffused mode network) deal with the problem. Move on and you'll eventually get a better ideas. 
	- A shutdown habit is not reducing the amount of deep work, it's diversifying it.

- Why shutdown? #2: Helps recharge for deep work
	- Study: Subjects who walked in nature were able to perform better on a cognitve task as compared to people who walk in a busy center of the city. (by 20%)
	- Directed attention is limited: walking in the city was using up the limited reservoir of directed attention
	- Walking in nature refills directed attention: "inherently fascinating stimuli" replenishes directed attention (eg. walk through nature). Keep your mind sufficiently occupied so that you're not focused on something. 
	- Study: 50 mins of replenishment gives major boost in concentration
	- Maybe walking leads to good mood which leads to increase in focus? No. The study was replicated in harsh winters where the subjects were not in a good mood.

- Ideas for refill time: casual conversation with friends, listening to smooth music while making dinner, playing with kids, going for a run, working out. 

- You need to convince yourself that work is done until next day to maximize recharge. Trying to squeeze in a little more out of your work evenings reduces your effectiveness for next day, and you'll get less done overall.

- Anders Ericsson's deliberate practice research: noivces have one hour a day of intense concentration, experts have 4 hours a day of intense concentration. Elite Violin players do 3.5 hours of deliberate practie in two sessions.

- Capacity for deep work is limited in the day, so you "will" hit your limit during your workday. Work in the evening will get shallow. So you're not missing out on much by deferring it.

- Do not let even brief intrusions. It affects your shutdown and recovery.

- Have a shutdown ritual
	- review all the things incomplete and put a plan in place.
	- capture progress in a place. You can take it up from there next time.
	- say shutdown complete.
	- do in the same order everyday.
	- Example: Cal's routine -- final look at email, transfer new tasks into day's task list, schedule these tasks, look at the calendar to ensure they don't oeverlap with other meetings, make a plan for next day, say shutdown complete. All of this takes 10-15 mins.
	- Shutdown routine takes two weeks to become a habit. 

- Study: Making plan to complete later helps you shutdown completely. It frees cognitive resources for other tasks. 

- When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done. Your refreshed ability become much better than your exhausted peers. 

### Strategy: Embrace boredom

- Adam Marlin had a church ritaul that is more demanding than his daily work. This made him much better at his job. (maybe meditation can do this for me?)

- It is difficult to focus. Just like it's difficult to lift heavy the first time you're in the gym. It needs hours of practice to strengthen your "mental muscle". 

- You will struggle to achieve the deepest level of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom. Be bored, fuck around doing nothing, day dream, that's not only okay but necessary.

### Strategy: Don't multitask

- Clifford Nass's research -- multitaskers: can't filter out irrelevancy, can't manage working memory, chronically distracted, irrelevant parts of the brain fire when working on a specific task. They are prpetty much "mental wrecks".

- The worst part is that multitaskers don't realize and their brain is being "rewired". Once your brain is accustomed to on-demand distraction, it's thard to share the addiction even when you want to focus.

- So, when you're waiting 5-minutes in the line or for your friend to arrive, don't use your phone. Use that time for leisure and day dreaming.This helps you extend how deep you can go when you work. Or you'll become a mental wreck.

- Intense work session need training with two goals: (i) improve your ability to concentrate intensely, (ii) overcome your desire for distraction. This allows you to move from a subconscious that always tells you to check social media into an instrument that has laser like foucs.

- Treat deep work as a religious routine, and never ever let distractions in. Letting distraction in once would rewire your subconcious and keep putting in the thought that you could check email each time the work gets hard. When work gets the hardest, is when you need the highest levels of focus.

### Strategy: Digital detox

- Take breaks from distractions, not focus. On most days, you need at most two hours of distractions a day (to answer emails, respond to messages). On some days, you need zero hours of distractions a day. Learn to be okay being bored. 

- Refrain from using internet (one day / week). Some people like WP suggest "learn to have a little disconnectedness, don't run away" -- this doesn't work. Because each time you're connected and distractd, you're rewiring your brain in the wrong direction and it's hard to get back. 

- Rules to implement:
	- Schedule times whne you'll use the internet, avoid it outside these times.
	- Schedule days when you won't your the internet.
	- Follow the schedule no matter how tempting, this is the key.

- Constant switching from high-brow to low-brow activities when you're bored, teaches your brain to never tolerate an absence of novelity. It can become a dangerous habit. Treat distractions like alcohol, use it as little as possible. 

- Minimize the number of times you give in to distraction, your attention-selecting muscles will strengthen this way. Not doing so weakens the mucles responsible for limiting various sources of attention.

- Practical suggestion #1: What if I'm waiting for an important email? Schedule checking email every 15 minutes. Schedule it using a timer. This way you spend much of your time fighting the desire to check email and hence building your muscles.

- Practical suggestion #2: Use a distraction sheet to keep track. When something urgent comes up, use atleast 5 mins before you check your mail / change your activity.

- Practical suggestion #3: Schedule internet use at both work and home. 
	- If you do it at work, and not at home; brain rewiring will fail.
	- You can have exceptions (eg. scheduling meet for dinner, finding a restaurant)
	- If you're dependant on internet for entertainment, scheudle long block of internet.
	- The key is not use reduce internet usage but to increase resistance training for the attention muscles. Most important place to train: when you're idle waiting in a line.

- To succed with deep work, you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. 



### Routines of some top performers

- Routines of some top performers:
	- Carl Jung: wake up + breakfast (7-8am), undistracted writing time (8-10am), meditation or walk in nature (noon), 10pm sleep -- at the Bollingen tower
	- Jason Benn: went from no programming experience to best coder. locked himself in with no computer (textbooks, flashcards and highlighter). intially hard but improved exponentially. completed 18 books by the end. used these skills to top a 100-hour week web application bootcamp. rented a place next to the office so that he can come & work early. gets 4-hour morning session and 3-4 hours in the afternoon.
	- Cal Newport: In 10 year post graduation: professor, papers, 4 books without ever working past 5.00 or 6.00pm. comfortable being bored. 3-4 hours of uninterrupted work, 5 days a week is all it takes. Maps out a schedule for deep work during the week, reschedule in the morning if necessary.
	- Adam Grant: 
		- youngest tensured prof at Wharton. went from being afraid of public speaking to one of the best communicator of ideas. 7 big articles, 5+books, 60 publications and spends lot of time thinking about producing at an elite level. 
		- key: batching of hard but important work into long uninterrupted stretches. teaches in fall, research in spring and summer. writing paper: (i) analysing data, (ii) writing full draft, (iii) editing it into publishable format -- takes 3-4 days. puts his email in autorespond
		- he doesn't work that much, but produces more.
	- Richard Feynman - "To do real good physics, you need a lot of concentration. If you spend time administering anything, you don't have the time."
	- Matthew Crawford: struggling with something for a while and then getting it to work gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other.
	- Winifred Gallagher: 
		- "what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore decide the quality of our life" 
		- "when you lose focus, your mind tends to focus on what's wrong in your life." 
		- "I'll live a focused life because that's the best kind there is." 
		- "Unless you can concentrate on what you want to do and suppress distractions, it’s hard to accomplish anything, period."
		- "If most of the time you’re not particularly concerned about whether what you’re doing is work or play, or even whether you’re happy or not, you know you’re living the focused life."
	- Charles Darwin: wake up and go for a walk (7am), breakfast along (7.30am), study (8.00 to 9.30am) , reply letters (9.30 to 10.30am), study (10.00 to 12.30pm). mull over challenging ideas and walk on prescribed roue until satified with thinking (1pm - 4pm). end of work day. 
	- (add from the link Pranoy shared with me)

Other thoughts:
	- Think from first principles about distractions. Be very careful about which distractions you let into your life. Rethink my relation to the devices I own. 
	- Unless you can't resist, stop work by 5pm everyday. 6pm worst case scenario.
