## Deep work by Cal Newport


- Deep work: Activity performed in a state of distraction free focus. The state of mental strain that accomplishes deep work is necessary to improve your abilities. Spend enough time in the state of shallowness and you will permanently lose your capacity for deep work. Deep work will be the super power of the 21st century.

- To succeed, you should (i) produce your absolute best work, (ii) be able to learn new skills quickly. Deep work is not only essential but also sufficient for both of these (for most skills). To learn requires intense concentration. 

- With AI taking over, most people will suffer and some people will thrive. (a) highly skilled workers (ML, AI), (b) superstars (best in the world), (c) owners. To get into (a) or (b), you need deep work. 

- In future, there's won't be full time hiring, instead consultation with best in the world to complete projects. There will be an online market to hire these people, and most projects will go to the best person (no one likes second best). Best person can serve more people because work is remote. Affects consulting, marketing, writing, design, etc. (creating a good online profile from now on is very important, get on down quicker than others!)

- Performance psychology: study of what seperates experts from rest. Anders Ericsson's deliberate practice (is what seperates the experts): (i) focus your attention on the skill you want to improve, (ii) receive feedback consistently to keep your attention on where it's most productive. 

- Neuroscience evidence: Skills boil down to brain circuits: you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around relevant neurons. With intense focus on a specific skill, you force the specific relevant circuit to fire again and again in isolation. With low concentraion, you're allowing too many circuits to fire simultaneously.  

- `highQualityProducedWork = timeSpent x intensityOfFocus` Best students understand the role of intensity, they go out of their way to maximize concentration.

- Attention Residue: when you switch tasks, residue of hte previous task remains. Shown to lead to poor performance. Email, notifications lead to residue. Even if it's as small as phone going off in the background, you lose focus. 

- Exceptions: Jack Dorsey: 40+ meetings in a day, anyone can walk in and talk. thrives without depth, his subordinates do the deep work and he only takes the final decision.

- Companies are embracing open officies, quick response to messages, etc. Why are they failing to see this? (i) impact is not measurable, (ii) principle of least resistance. (ii), protected from scrutiny by (i), supports such work culture. Leslie's experiments show that so much communication makes things worse (4 day work week increases productivity, less email communication increases productivity, etc.). 

- People tend to more communication because: (i) makes life easier, you don't need to plan in advance, you can be less organised, (ii) email helps you have the illusion of productivity. Without email, you're forced to plan what you should be working on and for how long. And busyness is often used as a proxy for productivity. A more relevant question to ask can be, "what did I do today, that wasn't there yesterday"

- Routines of some top performers:
	- Carl Jung: wake up + breakfast (7-8am), undistracted writing time (8-10am), meditation or walk in nature (noon), 10pm sleep -- at the Bollingen tower
	- Jason Benn: went from no programming experience to best coder. locked himself in with no computer (textbooks, flashcards and highlighter). intially hard but improved exponentially. completed 18 books by the end. used these skills to top a 100-hour week web application bootcamp. rented a place next to the office so that he can come & work early. gets 4-hour morning session and 3-4 hours in the afternoon.
	- Cal Newport: In 10 year post graduation: professor, papers, 4 books without ever working past 5.00 or 6.00pm. comfortable being bored. 3-4 hours of uninterrupted work, 5 days a week is all it takes. Maps out a schedule for deep work during the week, reschedule in the morning if necessary.
	- Adam Grant: 
		- youngest tensured prof at Wharton. went from being afraid of public speaking to one of the best communicator of ideas. 7 big articles, 5+books, 60 publications and spends lot of time thinking about producing at an elite level. 
		- key: batching of hard but important work into long uninterrupted stretches. teaches in fall, research in spring and summer. writing paper: (i) analysing data, (ii) writing full draft, (iii) editing it into publishable format -- takes 3-4 days. puts his email in autorespond
		- he doesn't work that much, but produces more.
	- Richard Feynman - "To do real good physics, you need a lot of concentration. If you spend time administering anything, you don't have the time."
	- Matthew Crawford: struggling with something for a while and then getting it to work gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other.
	- Winifred Gallagher: 
		- "what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore decide the quality of our life" 
		- "when you lose focus, your mind tends to focus on what's wrong in your life." 
		- "I'll live a focused life because that's the best kind there is." 
		- "Unless you can concentrate on what you want to do and suppress distractions, it’s hard to accomplish anything, period."
		- "If most of the time you’re not particularly concerned about whether what you’re doing is work or play, or even whether you’re happy or not, you know you’re living the focused life."
	- Charles Darwin: wake up and go for a walk (7am), breakfast along (7.30am), study (8.00 to 9.30am) , reply letters (9.30 to 10.30am), study (10.00 to 12.30pm). mull over challenging ideas and walk on prescribed roue until satified with thinking (1pm - 4pm). end of work day.

### Deep work is meaningful

- Deep work can generate a lot of satisfaction. Deep life is not just economically lucarative, but also a life well lived. MC: "Best moments in life occur when our body is stretched to it's limist in a voluntary effort to accomplish somethign difficult and worthwhile."

- Skillful management of attention is the key to a good life. Checking emails isn't rewarding (most emails are pointless) but being in the state of flow is inherently rewarding. 

- Flow make people happier than relaxation. More experiences of flow lead to a higher life satisfaction. To build your working life around the experience of flow / deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. 

- In this age of nihilism, craftmanship is what gives us divine meaning. See your work as your craft and doing it deeply as your purpose. And look at deep work as a religious ritual. 

- People fight desires (to watch TV, email, surfing web). These desires generally pop up into our mind when we're bored doing a hard task. Succumbing to is is a recepie for dissatisfaction. So, recognize it and use your skills of meditation to refocus on what's most important. 

- You have a finite amount of will power which depletes each time to fight a desire. Thinking about working out or not is generally less pressurable than the acitivty itself, the thought process is what makes us suffer more than the activity itself. And this suffering takes a toll on our will power. 

- Transisioning from shallow to deep work is hard. Example: 9.30 - 10.00 am -> shallow browsing, 10.00am -> work. Sitting idle, or meditating prior to the deep work session makes it easier. Minimizing residue from previous shallow tasks is the key. 

- Add routines / rituals to your working life so as to minimize the amount of will power needed to transision into deep work. 

- Decide on your depth philosphy: (i) monastic: isolate yourself completely from distractions, (ii) bimodal: definied stretches (of min. 1 day) of deep work and everything else (eg. Adam Grant, Carl Jung), (iii) rhythmic (same time everyday), (iv) journalistic (without schedule).

- A combination of (ii) and (iii) works best for me. Here's what I need to do: (for example, see Sept 2020 last week calendar)
	- Use (i) for the comlpetely unimportant distractions that take up my time. I will do this for cricket, by not following it for extended periods of time. 
	- As suggested by (ii), I need to have 2 stretches of 2 days of deep work every week. On these days, I minimize all distractions. I put all urges on a distraction sheet at attend to them at the end of the day.
	- As suggested by (iii), I will have 6 hours of work where I have 0-distractions everyday. (3 hours in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon)
	- I will spend rest of the day working on side projects that I enjoy, in a slow manner. For example, podcast, reading and writing. 

- People using their minds or valuable things are rarely haphazard. Plan things better; be clean and organized with objects in the room.

- Think like an artist and work like an accountant. Top artists never look for inspiration, just start doing it and stick with it irrespective of inspiration or boredom.

- Build rituals to the same lvel of strictness as previous thinkers. Minimize the friction to go deep by preplanning things:
	- where to work and for how long (needs to be an empty room used only for depth, have a fixed time frame, open-ended slog is horrible)
	- how you'll work once work starts (no internet, distraction sheet, having a plan and a metric for deep work (eg. how many pages you read), in pomodoros)
	- how you'll support your work (coffee and access to food, walks in nature in between)

- To work deeply is what helps you reach virtue (as suggested in Stoicism). Treat this work as a religious ritual, as a holy thing. Don't take it lightly.

- With a radical change in your environment, with a singnificant investment of money or effort, all dedicated towards supporting a deep task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. 

- Make grand gestures: JK Rowling checks into a 1000$/day hotel to write. Bill Gates chose week long retreat instead of seattle head quaters, Alan Lightman goes to a tiny island for 2.5 motnhs without internet or phone, Michael Pollan and Dan Pink built expensive writing cabins, Peter Shankman wrote his book flying business class, William Shockley didn't emerge from his room until he ironed out details for better transistor design.

- 


Other thoughts:
	- Think from first principles about distractions. Be very careful about which distractions you let into your life. Rethink my relation to the devices I own. 
	- Unless you can't resist, stop work by 5pm everyday. 6pm worst case scenario.
