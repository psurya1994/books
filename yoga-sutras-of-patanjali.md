Preface / introduction:
- Study them slowly. It is a practical handbook. Try to understand slowly. Get better a little everyday.
- The real practice of yoga is the understanding and mastery over the mind. "Raja yoga" -- the science of the mind
- The goal of this yoga is to get a person stuck in the endless loop of desires and aversions to a permanent peaceful state. 
- Take what's useful here, and make it yours. Leave what's not.

Book 1: Samadhi Pada

- 1.1: Yoga is not explained.
- 1.2: Yoga is the restraint of mind-stuff
	- The goal of yoga is to restraint the mental modifications (thoughts). If you can control the rising of mind into ripples, you will experience Yoga.
	- Keywords: 
		- Citta: sum total of the mind
		- ahamkara: the ego, the I feeling
		- buddhi: intellect or discriminative faculty
		- manas: the desiring part of the mind
	- Citta consists of the I feeling, the intellect and the desiring part of the mind.
	- example: when we smell chesse, the manas records it as a pleasant experience and the buddhi decides it's similar to what you had previously and the ahamkara decides that it should have some now.
	- We're in a peaceful state. We smell cheese that causes chitta-vritties (mind ripples) and disturbs the mind state. The goal of yoga is to restraint the vritties (the ripples on the surface of the ocean).
	- The entire world is based on your thoughts and mental attitudes. The world is just your own projection. Remember this, so that we don't put so much stress on outward things.
	- If you control your mind, you've controlled everything. Nothing can bind you.
- 1.3: after 1.2, the self / seer exists in it's own nature
	- You are that true seer. You're not the body nor the mind, because you can observe the changes happening in these. The seer is the one who knows these changes, but is not involved in them.
	- But to understand that eternal true self, the mind must be quite of ripples. Else, it will distort the truth. 
	- We are not our reflection in the mind. We can see the true reflection only when the mind is calm. 
	- You can see your true self when chitta is free from vritti.
- 1.4: at other times, the self appears to assume forms of mental modifications
	- I'm a "(fill anything)" -- this means that you're identifying with ideas gathered in your mind, that is not your true self.
	- Without these identifications, we're all the same. 
	- When we calm our mind to get to the basis of all these modifications, we will find unity among everything. 
	- We can function better with this experience of universal unity.
- 1.5: There are five types of mental modifications (which are painful or painless)
	- 2 major categories: one brings us pain (selfish thoughts), other doesn't (selfless thoughts)
	- If love causes you suffering, that's not true self less love. That love is based on some expectation. This kind of love always ends in mind.
	- Our first goal should be to have mostly self less thoughts.
	- It is not possible to make the mind thoughtless immediately. It is not easy to get there. So we target a easier goal of only having selfless thoughts.
	- The only selfish thought you can have is to retain peace for yourself. 
	- Watch your own thoughts and analyse thme to make these judgements.
- 1.6: They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep and memory
- 1.7: The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptual testimony.
	- (a) directly seeing the thing itself, (b) seeing proxies (smoke) and (c) it is in the scriptures
	- scriptues have been extensively validated by lots of people over many years.
	- all scriptures get at the same truth, just the presentation varies.
	- it'll be easier to dispose thoughts once we classify them. it will be hard to dispose everything. 
	- Analyse the painful thoughts and remove them. Keep the painless thoguhts. 
- 1.8: misconception occurs when knowledge is not based on true form
	- eg. when you this a rope is a snake and freak out
- 1.9: image that arises on hearing words (as it's basis) is verbal delusion
- 1.10: vritti supported by modification of nothingness is sleep
	- if you didn't have any vritti's during sleep, you would wake up without knowling that you slept.
- 1.11: vrittis caused due to a previously experienced object
- 1.12: these mental modifications can be restrained by practice and non-attachment
- 1.13: practice is the effort toward steadiness of mind at all times
- 1.14: practice becomes well grounded when well attended for long time without break, with full attention
	- 3 considerations for practice: with what quality / concentration, with what patience and for how long
- 1.15:
