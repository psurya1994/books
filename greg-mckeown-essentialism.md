## Essentialism by Greg McKeown

### Summary:

This book lays out a philosophy for life focused on doing less things, and how that can lead to a better life. 

### Who is an essentialist?

- THe way of the Essentialist is the relentless disciplined pursuit of less but better. It doesn't mean occasionally following it, instead it means pursuing it in a disciplined way. It is about constantly introspecting, "am I investing in the right activities?". The answer is "no" by default.
- Weak criteria for evaluation: "can I fulfill this request, given the time and resources I have?". Strong criteria: "Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time nad resources right now?"
- Saying "yes" to please backfires. The people who you say yes to will respect you less!
- If you don't prioritize your life, someones else will / some other forces will. Top regret before dying: "I wish I have the courage to live true to myself, not what others expected of me"

- Successful people tend to have more pressure. Because everyone wants your time. Success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first plcae.
- Survey: most companies fail because of the "undisciplined pursuit of more"

- Why is non-essentialism the default? (i) too many options (study: more choices we have, lower the quality of our decisions), (ii) social pressure in the hyperconnected world (people expect you to respond to messages quick), (iii) the idea that you can have it all. 

- This doesn't mean an haphazard "no", but a purposeful, deliberate and strategic elimination of the time wasters and some good opportunities as well.

- Closet is a good analogy to make this point. When you don't make a concious effort to keep it organized, it's a mess. You often end up with lots of clothes you'd never wear; you could accidentally give away clotehs you wear. Solution: have an active system of purging them. 

- Essentialist vs closet: 
	- Explore / Evaluate: Don't ask "is there a chance I might wear this?". Ask "Do I love this? Do I look great in this? Do I wear this often?"
	- Eliminate: Divide clothes into "must keep" and "probably should get rid of". To avoid sunk cost fallacy, ask "if I didn't already own this, how much would I spend to buy this?"
	- Execute: Have a regular routine for doing this. Have a big bag with clothes to give away; find where you can give and schedule a time to do this. 
	- It's important to have a system that makes things as effortless as possible. 

- Real life has active threats to your essentialist principles unlike a closet. This can't be a process you undertake once a week, you should apply this each time you're faced with a decision: say yes or politely decline.

- Essentialists use hte extra time to deliberately consider more options before deciding what to pursue. 

- Explore: Qs to find which option to pursue: (i) what deeply inspires me? (ii) what am I talented at? (iii) what does the world need?
- Elimiate: Involves saying no often; pushing against social expectations. Takes courage. 
- Executing: invest in creating systems that remove obstacles and make execution as easy as possible.

- Why? More contribution, more freedom, more satisfaction.

- Society needs a change in mindset: essentialists need to be celebrated. Instead of a person with busy schedule, celebrate person who has the courage to live true to his values.

- Reflect on how short life really is and what we want to accomplish in the little time we have left. 

- Self talk to be wary of "I have to", "this is also importnat", "I can do both". Self talk should be more of "I choose to", "only a few things matter", "I can do anything but not everything"


### Chapter 2: Choose

- The Essentialist is more aware of the choices he could make. It's less vulnerable to being in autopilot as he's taking the wrong path. 

### Chapter 3: Discern

- Our default when we fail is to work harder. But we have to focus more on efficiency. Eg. Warren Buffett: 90% of his income comes from just 10 investments (he invests in few). Good software developers don't spend extra time, but they get 10,000x more done.
- E spends extra time exploring options. This time is justified because some things are so valuable thhat they repay you 10x. 
- Rate all opportunities you get on a scale. Only pick opportunities that rate more than 8/10. You get better at telling the difference between what's important and what's not with practice. 

### Chapter 4: trade-off

- Only make choices that contribute to the end goal significantly. E.g. when building a product, it's easy to fall into the trap of building unimportant features. Spend time exploring all features the product can have, but focus only on doing a few things very well.

- Non essentialists always try to squeeze more in. Promise you'll do something by Friday even though you have a deadline on the same day. 

- Companies mission statements shouldn't be vague generalities "we value apssion, execution, innovation and leadership". They should show what they actually value "Customers are first; shareholders are last".

- You have a choice between spending time with your kids or writing a book. You can't do both. Kids are a big consideration for the essentialist, this choice limits you from picking side projects you're passionate about (if you want to be close to your kids)

- Don't decry tradeoffs, embrace them. Frame tradeoff positively. Instead of "What should I give up on?", think "what can I go big on?"

### Part 2: Explore

- NE gets excited too quickly and says yes. E is more careful, think about other options, before (liekly) saying no. 

### Chapter 5: Escape

- Scheduling time away from any distractions is critical. Time to just think helps.

- Case studies:
	- Newton spend two years in isolation for writing his magnum opus: Principia Mathematica.  
	- Author: went to a motel with no internet access for 8 weeks to complete the project
	- Greg: 5am to 1pm blocked, 5 days a week to write this book
	- Jeff Weiner (LinkedIn CEO): schedules two hours of blank space to think. Having converstaions all the time is tiring)
	- Bill Gates: takes week off, twice an year to spend time reading.


### Questions to ask yourself:
- Am I investing in the right activiites?
- What's my number one priority?
- "Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one short, wild and precious life?" Mary Oliver


### Case studies

- Sam Elliot
	- Got a new job and started saying yes to many things; stress qent up, quality of work went down. His mentor advised him to focus on the essentials and say no to everything else. 
	- He started refusing requests; colleagues were initally disappointed but started respecting him more over time. He didn't jump on email threads. He didn't attend meeting unless he had a direct contribution ot make. 
	- Spent the new found time to focus on one project at a time: planning throughly, working deeply and anticipating / removing obstacles. Quality of work went up. Got the largest bonus of his life.
	- Doesn't work after going home. Shuts off the phone, eats with his wife and goes to the gym. 

- Dieter Rams
	- Almost everything is noise. Only few things are essential. 

Quotes to think about:
