Summary:
The book argues that if you have a big strongly-held belief, you brain will figure out a way to acheieve it. The book covers tools and tricks on how to achieve things once you fix you mindset of having a big-belief. 

Chapter 1:
- The “I’m-positive-I-can” attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do.
- Belief, strong belief, triggers the mind to figure ways and means and how-to.
- Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts “reasons” to support the disbelief.
- It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don’t worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers.
- Steps to develop the power of belief:
	- Always think success, don't think failure (but do plan for it)
	- Remind yourself regularly that you're better than you think you are.
	- Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Big ideas and big plans are often easier—certainly no more difficult—than small ideas and small plans.
- To achieve,  you need to follow conscientiously and continuously a plan for self-development and growth.
- A good training program tells what to do, how to do and get results.
	- what to do: see what top performers do
	- how to do: you'll learn in this book
- See the world as a laboratory and you as a scientist. All you need to do is observe, develop theories (and appropriate plans) and experiment. 

Chapter 2: No excuses
- People use excuses to justify bad performance. You need to rather ask, "is this the best anyone can do given my situation?"
- Common exuses:
	- Poor health.
	- Not smart enough. 
		- We underestimate our brainpower and over estimate others. A better question to ask, "is this the best anyone can do given my smartness?"
		- The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than the intelligence you have.
		- Difference in thopught mangement plays a bigger role. Use your mind to think about ways to accomplish things rather than why they don't work out. 
	- I'm too old
	- I'm unlucky 
- Common regret: Had I been drilled a little more in why a small business can succeed, I’d be better off in every way today.

Chapter 3: Building confidence
- Most fear is psychological. All confidence is acquired over time. 
- Act promptly, instead of pondering on the fear. It's okay to make mistakes. No one regrets taking actions, they only regret not.
- Use your brain to think only positive thought (or plan for failure). Never waste time worrying about failure, rather just act. 
- Don't fear other people. No one has this sorted out [if anything I have it better sorted out, given the consistency of my routines, reading, meditation, etc]. Just take action and talk to more people, it's okay if you don't do that well initially. 
- When someone shouts on you, remember that it's not you, they're just having a bad day. So hold your fire and let it pass.
- Tips:
	- Shake hand, look in the eye, say "I'm very glad to meet you"
	- Be a front seater, enagge
	- Practice making eye contact when you're talking.
	- Each time you don't speak up, you're dropping your confidence. Speak up!
	- Smile big and be inviting of people.

Chapter 4: How to think big
- Change your thoughts. Change your langugage. Use big words to describe things. 
- See what can be, nto how it currently is. 
- Engage in meetings and keep adding value. Realize what you're uniquely good at during talks, and add appropriate value when you can in meetings.
- Visualize yourself as what you can be and start acting that way.
- Be active when you see an opporutnity to helps others / add value. 
- Think baout the big important things, more than minor trivialities.  

Chapter 5: think and dream creatively
- Note all your ideas down. Don't let them escape. Review them at the end of the week and turn them into concrete action steps. 

Chapter 6: you are what you think you are
- Just thinking that we deserve the most respect, makes us behave differently in the world, and we end of getting more respect.
- Thinking regulates all actions. Really think that we're very important. [don't think that you're super smart than everyone else and talk over them; but rather think that you're a smart decision maker and listen to all people carefully and then give your thoughts clearly "after listening to what you said, I believe that _____ because ____"]
- How to make others treat you as important? 
	- Look important. Dress right. Comb your hair. Press your shirt. People evaluate you by your appearance. Make people say "yes sir".
	- Believe your work is important. And that your contribution is key. This gives you mental signals on how to do you job better, and hence more prestige, happiness, and money.
	- Be enthusisatic. 
- Use self-affirmantions [when I do weekly reviews]. Believe that what you have to add is much more valuable than anyone else.

Chapter 7: Manage your environment - go first class
- Ensure that your environment is perfect and influences your conscious and subconscious thoughts correctly. 
- Associate with ambitious people who have good thinking. Don't let people who are negative be around and say that too many times. It affects your subconscious.
- Successful people are very accesible. Seek their advice. 

Chapter 8:
- You can tell people's attitude by looking at their actions.
- Be enthusiastic. Put vitality in your word. 
- Keep telling people that you feel great. Keep telling people why they feel great. See the good in people, and make them feel good after talking to you.
- Everyone wants to feel important. Make people feel important. People do more for you when you make them feel important. 
- Make small people feel like big people, and big people like even bigger. 

Chapter 9:
- Success depends on the support of other people. 
- The likable person gets an unfair advantage. 

Chapter 10:
- Take action, without postponing. Don't put things off for later. Helps get things done, increases confidence and opportunities. Don't wait to perfect before taking action.
- People bury ideas without acting on them and regret later. Act on your ideas to get brain tranquility. 
- Got a good idea? Do something about it now.
- To push for action, put yourself in that perfect surroundings, hold a pen and just start doing low quality work. Inspiration will come along and you'll start doing better work in no time. 
- Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. It's only going to be harder. And makes it more likely that you won't get it done. 

Chapter 11:
- Never complain when you're unable to accomplish things as you expect. It's hard business, keep a positive mindset and keep moving forward. 
- Learn from your mistakes. 

Chapter 12:
- Plan for 10 years ahead. Set goals and target dates. Have a burning desire. 
- Take one step at a time, one mile at a time. 
- Invest in education, keep improving over the course of your career. 

Chapter 13: thinking like a leader
- think in terms of the other person, and their interests. 
- treat people like humans: respect them, protect them, take care of them, don't hurt their feelings, avoid showing contempt, respect them.
- praise your subordinates, when talking to your superiors. 
- think and push for progress. don't settle for things the way they are. 
- spend enough time in solitude, to tap into your supreme thinking powers.


Surya's plan:
- what to do
- how to do
	- think all unclear decisions in writing: it ensure that you're thinking clearly and doing the best given your brain power (if you write about your theory and all possibilities).
	- by believing in a bigger version of your goals, talking about them bigly. 
- It's easier to be best at what you do rather than mediocre.
