#### Could you recommend what's helped you to read more books faster? And which books do you think have impacted you the most and changed your world view?
Surya: Reading more: consistency + listening & reading at same time + writing summaries / key points for all the books I ready
Top books: guide to the good life, midnight library, the courage to be disliked, beyond happiness

I feel very overwhelmed by the ghastly amount of knowledge available, so many things to learn, so many things that I haven't even discovered yet, so much to improve myself in, so much of a better person to be. 

And all of them can affect my life for the better, possibly even change its directions completely. 

Do you know how to deal with this? ðŸ˜…

[5:00 AM, 4/7/2021] Surya: Yea right! One thing I found useful was watching video summaries of various books at 2x on channels like Productivity Game; and taking notes of what I learnt. Can be a quick way to get an overview of a wide range of books.

[5:01 AM, 4/7/2021] Surya: Maybe you could focus on the things that you think will be most valuable at this point (or what you're most curious about) and focus on them more? You have all your life to cover these things.

What do you do when you're face with a problem you can't solve and need to let go? I'm having trouble letting go.  Any suggestions?
[11:14 PM, 4/23/2020] Surya: Firstly, I'm sorry that you're going through this. I feel bad. It's definitely not an easy thing to get through, here are some thoughts on my mind (pick what you think works before for you):
1. It sucks. But it will most definitely make you a stronger person few years down the line (unless it's life threatening). If you get through this, it will callous your mind and make you more robust to adversity. You'll be much less vulnerable to suffering in future. So, don't forget that there is a silver lining at the end of the road.
2. Often, the problem in these situations is that you think in loops. You can avoid it by thinking on paper instead of your head. Set a couple of hours aside, write down the problem and possible things you could do to make it better (if any). 
3. Focus on the controllables, don't think too much about the consequences of your actions. Just focus on the actions that are in your control, and keep taking the best actions you can based on the information you have. "we suffer more in imagination than in reality" -- all we need to be happy is food, clothing and shelter. Everything else is a social construct, we can train ourselves to be happy without it.
4. Don't sit idle, occupy yourself working on something you love. Sitting idle makes your mind go back into the same thought loops.
5. This is temporary. All the suffering you had in the past is gone. This will pass too. Except that it's going to make you stronger.
6. Adopting ideas for stoic philosophy is what many top performers do. In case you want to read more about it: https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/
7. If you're feeling emotional, use that energy to drive you to work harder, run longer, eat healthier, be more disciplined and everything else that makes life good. 
8. Spend time thinking about the things that you're grateful for (gratitude journaling).

Curious to know whatâ€™s your system with dealing with unexpected things in life ? Things that could be perceived as failures specifically
Surya: I boot up the Stoicism software in my brain when I face adversity. If you haven't read about it before, it's a philosophical framework for thinking (from ancient greek / rome) more clearly about life. It includes principles like: focus on what you can control, leave out what you can't; it's possible to be completely satisfied about life by taking right action this very moment, do your duty irrespective of what others think of you, etc.,
Surya: I've expanded on one of the ideas a bit more here if you're interested: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUzM2PTrdWRfpL7NuREMmiFU7krklB7Ms4fCu6KG9EY/edit
Surya: If I'm thinking about failure, here's how my internal self talk might look: Okay, I failed and I feel embarrassed / frustrated about it. What is it that I'm really fearing here? I don't fear the failure itself, but the judgement of people on the basis of this failure. Is it reasonable to fear how people judge you? No! When you do anything important, you will have a lot of people judging you and blowing up every small mistake. It's crazy to have my internal stage hostage to what people think about you (which is really, what you think they think about you; they're likely not even thinking about it). Also, I shouldn't even be wasting time thinking about it, because it's not something I directly control. All I control is the immediate next action I take in this moment. I'll put all my focus on just taking the right action in this very moment, and be blissfully satisfied about it. 

What's the best thing I can do right now? Probably take a nap and recover. So let me sleep now! [and I feel reasonably satisfied about it]
