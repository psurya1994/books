Notes from Lex + John Danaher: 
- Don't listen to you coach who talks as if he knows everything and says someone better than him is wrong. 
- People like John Danaher became the best from nothing by just spending time with the best. I need to do more of that in my life; it might be spending more time with people like Blake and Spencer?
- Initial ideas you have are like babies. Treat them in a fragile way. Don't push too hard too early. Give them time to develop and grow. For example, you have an idea, don't test it against the harshest criticism just yet. Spend time on it, develop it, and slowly include more adversity in the environment. 
	- In my case, if I want to make YouTube videos, I need to start simple. Take time to improve them, don't focus on reasons why it doesn't work just yet. 
- Persistence is the most important thing. 
- Have 0 ego in the BJJ training room. Explore more. Lose to lower belts, it's okay. 
- Train being in hard positions and getting out of them. So in real ;life, you'll truly express yourself without fear of being in a weak position. That's what gives teh ability to attack without fear. 
- Have a strong belief in your skills. Train to build this confidence. Everythign else will flow naturally. 
- Train on the escapes first. Get really good at getting out of bad positions. The confidence in rest of your game will flow naturally. 
- This is similar to doing science. Read hard papers and learn to understand them. Learn to have conversation with researchers who are not in this area of study. Learn to make sense of things in hard lectures by askign good questions. 
- Keep making your environment harder as your skills get better. To avoid reaching plateau. 
- Make sure every action you take, every drill you practice makes you better at something. And work in a way such that it happens consistently. Don't focus on the number of reps, focus on which problems you're trying to solve and how you're progressing. Doing reps can help initially, but it plateaus. 


The course of love

The book start to get very interesting from chapter 5; it talks about the common things that couples fight over. And suggests better ways in which the conflicts can be handled (by openly acknowledging our character flaws and explaning why we want things to be a certain way).

Staus anxiety:

The author thinks openly about the consequences of advacement in our material world and our expectations. Counter intuitively, even though we have more than anyone in history, we tendd of compare ourselves with our peers and feel bad about it. The idea of equality has become the trigger for status anxiety 

When you pretend to be something you're not, you risk humiliation. 

Why did it happen?
- higher expectation through ideas of equality, freedom and media (ads making you want things you don't like). 

The desire for status is the single biggest flaws in our thinking. Being ambitious is seen as a good thing, but it often makes people vulnerable to suffering when they fail. 

I read the book status anxiety. It talks about the problem (associating a high social status with a high regard and low status with low regard) and ways to tackle it. He talks about philosophy (thinking clearly and arguing why other people's thinking of you doesn't matter) and 

what kinds of things do i enjoy doing?

i enjoy inspiring my little cousins, maybe I should spend more time doing that. Maybe spend time building circuits with them? 
do I want to double down on my career? or on my side projects? side projects sounds like a much better idea
people are struggling to find a girl to marry, I'm lucky

Do not have a theory of mind!

Chasing status is like playing a video game and trying to increase your money. Even though it doesn't actually make anything better.
 

 It's crazy the amount of oppression happening in North Korea, why aren't we doing something about it? why are we still giving them money for diplomacy?

Peace is every step
This is a great book talking about the importance of finding peace by being mindful in any situation (stuck in a traffic jam, failed on an exam, phone ringing). Before doing anything, just take that extra moment to breath and smile. The goal is to While reading the book, I realized that focusing on the breath can actually be blissful when complimented with gratefulness. 

THis is a great book to listen to when I'm falling out of my meditation routines. Or maybe while I'm working out or while doing chores. I need to absorb the ideas here like I've absorbed the ideas of Stoicism.
