Schopenhauer has a interesting perspective on love. He see the world as a battle of wills, the life force that drives our desire to eat, marry, have kids, etc. He argues that it's this force that drives us to have kids, it makes no sense from a purely rational perspective. 

- Kant: there are two worlds -- things in themselves and our experience of those things.
- we have this restless striving for things. the desire for things. on the other side of the veil of experience, there is the will to life for all beings. there are infinite wills fighting.  and you desire love and children because of this force. children make no sense from the perspective of rationality.

- we always restlessly strive for things in a perpetual state of discontent
- appretiating the beauty of nature / music is one way to get over this discontent for a small time. 
- pinnacle of human virtue is to live an asetic life and not engaging in this game of "will to life".

Eps 083 PT HDT

- transcedentalism: the idea that you need to take the top ideas from various philosophies and you need to arrive at them yourself. don't be a passive drone confirming to the things around you. HDT decides to live deliberately based on that philosophy.
- it wasn't hard for him to adjust because he was already discontent with society (slavery, corporal punishment, etc.,). he was way ahead of his time and endoresed non violent protest. the more you own stuff, the stuff owns you. 
- learns that the solution to life is you, not the things that are outside you. like the trees weathering sun, snow, wind without resistance, do the same to live a good life.
- don't passively go along. he went to jail for not paying taxes.

Eps137 John Rawls
- Supports liberal democracy and talk about a just society. 
- We need to structure society of the veil of ignorance. Doesn't that lead to socialism? Rawls was not a fan of socialism because he thinks that makes everyone worse off than the worst person in a liberal democarcy. 
- inequality is okay as long as it makes the lives of everyone else including least advantages better better. eg. entreprenuers, atheletes, top researchers, etc.,


Eps 095: are you living in a simulation?
- decartes: yes I see things, I feel things, but how do I know I'm not a brain in a vat? How do I know this reality is not maintained by an evil demon somewhere? 
- nick bostrom's 2003 paper: key argument for this theory. Given the rate of technology, one of three things has to be true: (i) we kill ourselves before simulating reality, (ii) we lose interest, (iii) we do reach it and it's likely that we're in a simulation than we're not.
- philosophers and scientists still debate if it's possible or not to create such simulations.
- why would such a god-like species simulate us? (i) to maximize conscious well being in the world, (ii) to test out a economic theory before implementing it in the base reality (but isn't this super inefficient? maybe. but maybe this is the only way to get at accurate results)

Eps 096: Ayn Rand
- argues that altruism is bad. attacks all their peers and other philosophers. 
- humans use concepts, which is the distinguishing feature. don't use people as means to an end. makes claims without strong justification. 

Eps 009: buddha
- had hedonistic lifestyle, moved after seeing suffering.
- preoccupation with self is the core of suffering. adopted ascetic lifestyle that wasn't getting him anywhere. decided to take a middle ground under a fig tree, not moving until he acheieved enlightenment or died. learned a about overcoming suffering.  
- came up with 4 noble truths to end suffering: 
	- suffering is the default state (even if you're excited a little, it wears off back to the default)
	- what is the cause? desire, expectations. from attachment, aversion or ignorance. ignorance: there are no good or bad things, they are just things
	- what is the soln? suffering can be eliminated by ending desire. and  getting rid of the illusion of self. understanding the cosmic perspective.
	- roadmap? morality, meditation and wisdom.
- the human condition is like you committed a crime of bring and a sadistic judge who had a kanck for creative justice sentenced you for a life of a guy who works for hte state following you around every waking moment to tell you about you non-stop. this is the human condition. 

Ep 085: Peter Singer
- Acts of commision vs ommision. We see people who don't help a drowning child as monsters. But we live in a world where 6.9mil children die an year due to preventable poverty related causes. We have access to resources and charities that drastically reduce that number, but we choose not to.
- Singer: Congrats on winning the lottery. we make a lot of money to buy stuff we don't need, we're the billionaires of human history. that doesn't make you a bad person, it just gives you more opportunity to help.
- Toby Ord: needs 18k$ an year to live comfortably. using the remaining money he makes over his career, he can give back to cure 80k people of blindness. 
- Peter: we don't have to do all that, just donate 10% of your income. we need to be affective about it. 
- Look at what personal comfort you can give up to do the most good you can possibly do. For Stephen West, it was doing this podcast. 
- The virtuous thing is to work hard and continue to make more money so that you can contribute more to charities.

Ep 084: William James
- As scientists, we use our completely arbitarary set of mental faculties that we have to collect and analyse data hoping that we will get to the truth. Truth is how things are out there. 
- William James: What if truth is more like beauty or justice (which are more subjective based on cultures)? Tough minded: asks for more evidence, atheists. Tinder minded: more dogamtic. Invents pragmatism to reconcile both these views. 
- Diamond is soft but is only hard when something is touching it. There's nothing false about it. Pragmatic maxim: the meaning of a concept is the sensory affect of it's object.
- Everything is true that doesn't violate observed data. (ignores occam razor) Truth is anything that can predict unseen data well. 
- Somehow connects things that are true to usefulness. Like Jordan Peterson, but not as extreme. 
- Truth is an adjective describing a specific type of experience. So in 14th century Europe, it is true that the earth is flat.
- I'm not convinced with these ideas. Sam Harris, I think, could convincingly counter argue against these ideas. Usefulness and truth are independent things. 

Ep 048: Adam Smith
- Father of moderin economics.
- SW: I feel happy because I'm the most priviledged king. You have everyone around working to impress you. Atheletes training their best everyday just to entertain me for a bit. People putting so much effort into creating content just to get my attention. People have restaurants trying to serve you the best food they possibly have. I'm living in this modern day colloseum. I'm driving a car that's more powerful than 200 horses. 
	- Taking this "me" centric view of the world seems very powerful. The view that everyone's doing things to impress you. 
	- It doesn't matter why people are doing something, what's only relevant to you is what value they're adding to your life. 
	- Even if we're a 15th century monarch, and try to replicate the 20th century NFL, it'll be a much inferior product. 
- What do you get for 1 hour of work today compared to 200 years ago? 
	- 1800: 1 hour of candle was 6 hours of work
	- 1880: 1 hour of light was 15 mins of work
	- 1950: 1 hour of light was 8 seconds of work
	- 2010: 1 hour of light was 0.5 seconds of work
	- we're 43200 times wealthier in terms of producing light. why? technological innovation + specialization + society. people acting in self interest create all of this. 

Eps 049: Adam Smith
- why are some countries are richer than the others? the wealth of a nation is the quality of it's labor force. 
- mercantilism: economic policy of a country to maximize exports and minimize imports. flawed idea in history. doesn't optimize long-term well being. Adam recognizes that maximizing imports of good we can't efficiently produce here is the key. Free trade benefits both sides. 
- government needs to give a strong sense of law, that your money won't be stolen if it wants to get rich. it makes the labor work harder.

Eps 024: Montaigne
- He was plauged by fear of death. It changed with a single traumatic experience. Gets into a horrible horse accident, puking, peeling his own skin, etc.,
- He didn't remember (or maybe wasn't even conscious of) any of it, he didn't feel any pain, the experience wasn't really bad at all. It felt similar to falling asleep.
- Most scientific generalizations fail over and over again. There will always be exceptions, and new theories come up. Let's not focus on getting to core truth. 
- We can't be sure that everyone has similar experiences like us. So the most reliable thing is our own experience, not a survey of others. 
- Convention: think about death enough and you'll get used to it. Montaigne thought this was dumb, you're needlessly scaring yourself. Accept that we don't know how death feels like. Don't agonize things we cannot know. 
- Old person stereotype who says whatever he feels like. who doesn't care what other people think, he's been through two wars, what else does he have to fear. even if everyone rejected him, he can still wake up next morning and watch Netflix. 
- It's complete madness to stick to social convention. 
- If an alien enters the world, they might think dogs rule the world and we're the slaves. They have much better lives. 

Eps 079: Kierkegaard
- "Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom".
- Biggest danger: losing yourself. Most people are not true to themselves: (i) they either stick to social conventions or (ii) stuck being indecisive about all the things they can do in the world. 
- (ii) causes a dizziness. as humans, we need to make a choice at somepoint. But we have the nagging thought, what if one day, when I'm 60 I wake up and realize that I was chasing the wrong thing. 
- This is the essence of anxiety, being afraid of something that we have little control over anyway.
- Freedom can be a blessing and a curse. Humans seem to be happier when they have fewer choices. Freedom breeds discontent. Leads to dread / despair. 
- Big despair: conflating your identity over some material external that you have no control over. eg. seeing swimming as your identity, and not being able to swim anymore after an accident. But that's not you! 
- The default is anxiety / despair. We can run from it by distracting ourselves and making identities, but we'll have to face it at some point. 
- Learn to embrace anxiety. The more anxiety you feel, the closer you are to your true self. See this as the pain when lifting weights in the gym. 
- Find a purpose that's worth living. He's the father of existentialism.

Eps 072: insecurity
- Everyone around you is insecure, and it is affecting their behavior. Generally in the form of not taking risks, and trying to prove to others that you're capable. 
	- what am I insecure about? not knowing enough ML.
- If you're switching to a job that pays 20k more because your friends earn that amount, you're paying a huge cost. If you're dating a cute girl instead of someone who you connect with, you're paying a real price everyday of your life. 
- The reason we don't want our partner to spend time with other people of the opposite sex is because of insecurity. What if they like them more?
	- Does this make things better? No. Does this stop your partners desire to date others? No.
	- We potentially hurt others and ourselves in this process of projecting insecurity.
- The social standards that you're embarassed for constantly keep changing. 

Eps 138: Robert Nozick 
- Is govt a good way to solve social problems?
- The minimal state. The state should only enforce the minimal entitlements and rights. No one should be harmed against their will. You could only pay things you consent for.
- argues against john rawls's liberal democracy. it's a version of slavery.
- centralized monopoly creates more problems than it solves.

Eps 028:
- rationalism: you can arrive at truth using reason, empiricism: you can arrive at truth by analysing sensory observations


Eps 108: The Farkfurt School
- neitzsche: god is dead -- he's talking about the void that is left without god (now that no reasonable personal can believe in a personal deity and seek safe belief). this void wi


Witgenstin
neitzsche


my ideas:
- if we just want to minimize net human suffering or maximize human well being, why isn't the optimal thing to do is to reproduce as much as possible or kill as many as possible? what if instead, the goal is "minimize suffering of all presently living beings" (I'm now reasoning to justify the moral intuitions I have as suggested by Johann Hadith)
- research idea: build multi agent openai environments such that the agents repicate the activity of ant colonies. this would help us understand the principle behind ant colonies. 
- You don't know what your future self is going to be like. Act according to your best guess is on what makes you happier.
