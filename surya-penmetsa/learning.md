Regarding my career, Iâ€™ve decided to go all in. Not on the standard paths that many people compete on (raising up the corporate ladder or starting a company), but on quenching my curiosity by learning new things. I'm sure exciting opportunities will come along the way.

How do I go about this? I will decide one topic that I want to extensively learn about each week, and spend all my free time trying to learn more and frame my thoughts on that topic. At the end of the week, I will either write on the topic or make a video explaining the things that I learnt.

### Week Jan 10 - Jan 16

Topic: Data Privacy
