The focused mind.

What's the opposite of a distracted mind? I call this the focused mind. The focused mind is the state in which you feel good, your system one is in control, even if you feel stress it doesn't strike you off balance or put you in negative feedback loops. 

How do you get closer to the focused mind?
- meditation
- getting in touch with daily necessities of life
- doing deep meaningful work (but be sure this doesn't affect the daily necessities)

The goal is to stay as long as possible in the focused mode. Focus doesn't mean that you're actively focusing on a task, it just means that you're in control of your experience where system 1 > system 2. 

Basic necessities > productivity. health > relationships > money.
