I've realized that it's very easy to skim through books and having the illusion of understanding them; but forgetting important aspects in no time. It is because I'm neither thinking clearly or consolidating the material I'm reading. I often struggle to explain the main ideas of the book eloquently when talking to people. This repo is to fix all of it.

I'll write my own summaries / interpretations of hte books I read here, and will refer to the notes back here. 

Disclaimer: I summarize my understanding of these books, and add my flavor into those ideas. So what you read here might not be entirely representative of what the author is conveying.
