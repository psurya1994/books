Preface:
- In business, when you are successful, people want more and more of your business. So you need to gaurd yourself from other people, and teach the managers in your team to do the same.
- Causing inflection poitns is easier than being a victim to it. 
- No company owes you a career, you're the sole proprietor. Your career is a business with one employee, and you're in competition with millions of other businesses. You need to take ownershipf of your career, skills and timing of your moves. 
- This book covers how you find your way in uncharted territories, when there's an inflection point in society (eg. advancements in AI). It's possible that jobs previously done by 1000 people can now be done by 10 people. 

Chapter 1:
- issue at intel: chips had a bug
- you deliver to customer based on unstated rules, but sometimes these rules change significantly without warning. you need to recognize this can change behavior accordingly.
- middle managers see this first (than the CEO), the sales people.
- expose yourself to outside information to see these changes happening.

Chapter 2: 
- the ideas that got you to 10x won't take you to 100x, you might need to fundamentally change how you do business
- the 6 forces that determine well-being of a company:
	- competence, power and vigor of competitiors: how many? well funded? do they focus on your business?
	- competence, power and vigor of competitor's suppliers
	- competence, power and vigor of the customers
	- competence, power and vigor of potential competitors
	- possibility that your service can be built / delivered in a different way (the most deadly of all)
	- competence, power and vigor complementors: complimenting technology that your business needs; new technology could interrupt this dynamic
- when any of this changes by 10x, then all bets are off. you'll have to fundamentally change how you do business. this we refer to as the inflection point
- it is very difficult to handle such changes because same actions you took before don't work anymore. 
- this change happens slowly, and it's hard to recognize because many people will try to explain that away
- how do you know when is the appropriate time to move onto a new strategy, that you're in an inflection point? you don't. you can try experimenting new ways when your business is healthy.

Chatper 3: how to handle inflection points
- when a competitor becomes so strong and changes the way business is conducted, hard to deal with. this dynamic remains the same, no matter what industry, location or era.
- intially, in the computer industry, everything was done by the same company: chips to OS to software to sales. technology changed, and you could put more chips on one board now -- this changed the way sales are done in the computer indsutry. 
- companies that see the new way the business is done, and focus all their efforts there will grow drastically. big companies, if they are slow to make this change, die.
- at the inflection point, you need to build things quickly and get the compementors you use to tech soon. get them to be dependant of you. other complementors will follow. 
- at the inflection point, the old guys have more trouble than the new people who just come up. new competitors can come in with almost no cost.
- rules to handle an inflection point
	- #1: make improvements in directions customers care about; don't just do them to look better on paper against your competitor. 
	- #2: when a technology change comes your way, grab it immediately. time is everything, to gain the market before your customers. people who resist the new technology will lose inspite of their best efforts.
	- #3: price for volume, what the market will bear, and deliver at that price. once you get the volume, you can start making profits. 
- horizontal companies (who specialize) will be more cost effective than the ones who try to do everything

Chapter 4: examples of inflection points
- 10x change happens in every industry, not just the tech. Examples:
	- walmart entering a small town
	- sounds technology introduced in movies
	- shipping container revolution for transportation
- read newpaper through the 10x lens to spot the changes
- 10x change: competition
	- walmart is an example of megacompetition, it does business differently and lures away your customers. when this happens, you need to change your behavior. what would work again walmart? maybe speciailization, customized service, redefining your store as an environment instead of product.
	- when jobs was developing for next (software developer tools targeted for mac), PC took over (a 10x change) that made all his efforts futile. PC became far more cost effective than mac. 
	- jobs saw the inflection point when he was 20. jobs missed the inflection point when he was 30. we're all vulnerable to not seeing this. 
- 10x change: technology
	- technology changes once in a while so that something can be done 10x better, faster or cheaper.
	- when music was introduced in movies, actors had to adapt. even charlie chaplin wasn't able to stick to old ways. some actors adapted quick, and become success very quickly. 
	- shipping transformation for transport: needed countries to reorder their shipping ports. singapore became big because it adapted quickly. 
	- pc revolution: fundamental rule of technology - whatever can be done, will be done. conventional companies that didn't extrapolate the reducing costs of computers, lost.
- 10x change: customers
	- customers changing their buying habits 
	- changing tastes in cars
	- attitude change in customers (eg. intel's P4 1994)
- 10x change: suppliers
	- generally you can replace them, but when a 10x change happens they have far more power over you
- 10x change: complementors
- 10x change: regulation
	- introduction of FDA for drugs
- reason why companies fail to see the change: 
	- CEO is too far up the hierarchy, sales people see this first
	- explaining away leading indicators by "poor economy"
	- resistance to change to a painful new world. the star of the last era is generally the slowest to change. 

Chapter 5: on handling inflection points
- To get through the inflection point, it takes objectivity, willingness to act on convictions and passion to mobilize other people into supporting these convictions.
- You cannot fully commit to having just one key project, have multiple other projects running on the side. We never know what is going to work, and what will stop working. 
- It is very painful when a competitor is 10X better than you. If you're unable to compete with them directly, you need to pivot or specialize. You're often too late to pivot than too soon to. The CEOs see it more slowly than others in the company, so when CEO confirms the pivot, employees would actually feel more satisfied. 
- Focus on the industry where you can be the top. Don't fight for the dwindling share of a very competitive market, where you know you'll struggle to be the best at.

Chapter 6: 
- how do we know if an inflection point is happening? from what you learn through broad and intensive debates.
- when you see technological changes happening around you, it's hard to tell if it's a 10x factor. So watch it as a blip on your radar screen. Continue keeping track of it. 
- when you have two competing products, teams internally will fight for the limited resources in the organization: both engineers and sales people. 
- how to see the signal from noise:
	- see if there are new competitors coming up, and challenging you
	- is your key complementor about to change?
	- too much difference in top management opinions? we've been selected to the top of the org to have similar opinions. if they have dissenting opinions, that means that something fundamental is changing.
- listen to your sales / middle managers carefully. ask them for opinions on changing demands in the market.
- productivity: moving resources from a lower yield process to a higher yield process
- if you see that a competitors product, which does business differently, when improved can affect your market; it might indicate the start of an inflection point.
- if you're in middle management and you see a fundamental change in the business, it is important for you to point it out to the upper management now. 
- fear of losing is a good motivator. for both yourself, and the middle managers. don't punish any of the messengers, hear them out well. 

Chapter 7:
- resolution only comes through experimentation. setting out of old ruts brings new insights.
- when there's an inflection point, this is what managers tend to do: denial -> escape / diversion -> acceptance -> pertinent action
- lesser managers find it hard to get to acceptance, they might need to be removed. new people would come in with a blank mind and is not investedin the past, and can see things more clearly.
- the inertia of success: when previous behavior lead to success, we continue to do them even though the environment has drastically changed. we cling to the old ways, harder hoping for different results. 
- strategic dissonance: there will be a big difference between beliefs and actiosn during the inflection point. 
- experimetnation: you need to let chaos reign, go around and explore different things to see what works the best
	- it's hard to suddenly start experimenting once you see 10x, you need to start doing it from well before
- it's easier to make changes to company strategy when it's healthy, rather then when it's market is dwindling.
- you will have to write, draw diagrams to be able to think clearly. start with discussing with immediate friends while refining these thoguhts. 

Chapter 8: 
- If we get through the inflection point on top (or towards the end of it), it is important to be clear about what we will be doing, and what we won't be.
- Be careful not to make the company vision based on inclusiveness / satisfying the needs of every manager. 
- As a CEO, how you spend you time gives a clear messages about what's important and what's not for the company. Make sure that your actions are inline with your vision. 
- It will take time to convey this vision, do it again and again so that people get it. 
- This will need redeploying resources. You need to do it at the right time. This is when your existing strategy is positive (because moving back is not too hard then). 
- "The early movers are the only companies that have the potential to affect the structure of the industry and to define how the game is played by others."
- Remove the managers who're not will to adapt / adjust to the new world. 

Chapter 10: career inflection points
- For individuals, getting burned out after doing the same job for 10 years can be an inflection point too. Major changes in either externals or internals can change your worklife.
- Just like you company, you should respond to market forces, head off competitors, take advantage of complementors and be alert to different ways of doing business. It is your responsiblity to protect your career from hard, and to position yourself to changes in the environment.
- When you're working for a big company, it's easy to just rely on them for security. You feel that you're shielded from all the changes that happen. But you're not. 
- To succeed, be paranoid about your career. Feel fear. Keep track of the news to get a sense of the changes happening. Hear the conversations happening about the future of work in your field. 
- Plan how would you reposnd to changes that would affect you. Are you confident of learning the new ways?
- Timing is very important. If your career is starting to slow down (or of your colleugues), you'll likely be in denial thinking this is temporary. So be aware, and run the early experiments / make the switch earlier rather than later. 
- If you take advantage of the inflection point quickly, you'll get the best opportunities and advantage over slow movers. 
- Keep trying ideas on the side, to have other careers you can fall onto if this one doesn't work. Examples of experimentation: moonlighting on second job, going to school, asking your employer for a very different assignment, etc. Look for a job that takes advantage of the changes. 
- Ask quesitons: What do you think the nature of your industry is going to be in two or three years? Is this an industry you want to be a part of? Is your employer in a good position to succeed in this industry? What skills do you need to progress in your career in this new landscape?
- If you see downfall, you need to clearly commit to a new path and learn things again. This will suck temporarily, but is good in the long term.
