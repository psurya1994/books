Viva Primordium
- There is one cause of one aging: ____
- Immunte T-cells go around the body looking for rogue cells and kill them before they can multiply in a cancer. Cancerious cells learnt to avoid the T-cells. Immunotherapy binds protiens to the cancer cells so that they can be detected.
- Until recently, we thought cancer was untreatble. But we've invented immunotherapy that changed everything. Aging is similar but a much easier problem to solve. 
- There is no unified theory for aging. One common theory is that because 
DNA has more and more mutations over time, we mutate ourselves into oblivion. 
- Free radicals damage DNA through oxidation. Anti-oxidant rich diet's positive health effects are because they stimulate body's natural anti-aging process by boosting the enzymes for eliminatiing the free radicals. 
- Recent study: increase in free radical production did not reduce the lifespan of mice. This suggests that mutation is not the primary cause of aging.
- David's theory: aging can be explained by the loss of genetic information. Two types of information: digital (T,C,G of DNA), analog (epigenome: heritable traits that aren't transmitted by genetic means -- stored in chromatin). 
- Analog information is more unstable and degrades more easily. 
- Dozens of "logevity / vitality" genes are discovered by scientists. They decide how much protiens and chemicals to release into the bloodstream. 
- Sirtuin geners: SIRT1 to SIRT7 -- at the forefront of medical research. They remove acetyl tags from histones and protiens, and change the packaging of the DNA. They control health, fitness. They require a molecule called NAD. The loss of NAD might be the reason why we get sick when we're old but not when we're young. 
- Siruins can buckle down in times of stress ot avoid disease. Boosting NAD has +ve benefits in mice, it helps them stay fit irrespective of what they eat.
- Other genes: TOR (similar function as Siruins), AMPK (responds to low energy levels)
- What activate longevity genes: exercise, intermittent fasting, low-protien diets, exposure to hot and cold temperatures. 

The Demented Pianist
- "Youth → broken DNA → genome instability → disruption of DNA packaging and gene regulation (the epigenome) → loss of cell identity → cellular senescence → disease → death."
- Epigenetic changes cause aging.  Genetic forces are surprisingly low: 10-25%. 
- epigenome: thje control system that tells the cell which geneous should turn on and which should remain off. 
- SIR2 reduced aging in yeast. 
- DNA changes with again. Specifically, it develops ERCs (circular patterns on it's surface). As ERCs increase, aging get worse. 
- Feeding less sugar to yeast cells slows down a lot of the aging process. 
- SIR recovers DNA damage. 
- Sirtuins generally focus on regulating genes. But when there's DNA damage, they go to fix the DNA before returning back to their normal function. 
- If there's too many emergencies to repair DNA, some of the basic cell functions such as reproduction is not done. This alters the epigenome is ways never intended. 
- David tested these theories on the mouse and confirmed that they work. 
- Feeding mice a molecule intendeed to boost NAD (believed to increase SIRs), the mice doesn't stop running. 
- Treating mice with NAD makes their epigenome more stable. And hence, reversing aging. 

The Blind Epidemic
- Aging itself is the disease. Alzheimers, heart disease, cancer, etc., are symptoms of the disease. 
- Smoking accelerates the aging clock and makes you die 15 years earlier. 
- A hip injury at 20, you recover. hip injury at 40, life-altering but not fatal. hip injury at 65, you die in 6 months. 
- wounds also are healed slower with age.
- Makes a strong case as to why aging is the key problem, and has to be fixed. 

Longevity now
- more veggies, less meat. fresh food > processed food. 
- to longer your lifespan, eat less. fasting is unquestionably good for our health and longevity.
- Studies: calorie restriction that doesn't cause malnutrition leads to increased lifespan, across all species. have just enough food to function in healthy ways, no more. 
- CR diet has demonstrated reduced cardic disease, diabetes, stroke and cancer. 
- Intermittent fasting works in mice. They make longevity genes do the wokr. 
- IGF-1 can be used to estimate age at which someone dies. 
- Amino acids: 
	- organic compounds that server as building blocks for protien
	- used to assemble important enzymes for life. 
	- meat is not good for our body
	- limiting amino acids helps
	- limit diary and meat
	- just get enough, so that the bilogical circuit is not satiated and stops working.
- exercise
	- people who exercise more have longer telomeres (less erosion)
	- applying stress to the body, forces the body to generate more oxygen-carrying cappilaries. 
	- HIIT is much better than other forms of exercise to promote anti-aging circuitry 
	- 70-85% heart rate, sweating and heaving breathing is important. 
	- eating more, and burning it on a run is not good enough (not in rats atleast).
	- you need to feel hungry, to get the benefits of the longevity harmones. 
- the cold front
	- exposing your body to uncomfortable temperatures is another way to turn on the longevity genes.
	- take brisk talks in the cold wearing just a t-shirt: with goosebumps, chattering teeth and shivering arms
- other ideas
	- avoid smoking, pollution, fireworks
	- avoid carcinogenic foods: they are accelerating aging. even food with mercury can accelerate aging. 
	- avoid radiation
- takeways:
	- calorie restirction / intermittent fasting
	- high intensity exercise (HIIT)
	- walking outside in cold
	- use sauna

A better pill to swallow
- more about the history of how anti-aging drugs were discussed.
- diabetes is pretty bad: blindness, kidney failure, stroke, open wounds, limb amputations.
- anti-diabetes drugs: seems to improve human lifespan. seems to activate NAD to generate more sirt1. 
- Metformin is very convincing to slow aging, but doctors don't prescribe it even with all the data because they believe aging is not a disesase. It's available over the counter in many countries, but not the west.
- We've discovered alternative ways to slow down aging, instead of calorie restriction.
- avocado, broccoli and cabbage boost NAD
- NAD pushes our longevity fenes into action to supress epigenetic changes. 
- Lots of anecdotes on how using NMN + metformin (that boost NAD), really changes things for old people.


Big steps ahead

x---x ending the book here, because I think I've got most of what the book has to offer.


We have techniques to do much better, but the doctors don't adopt them. Doctors just treat with what works for most people most of the time. We have technology to do much better but doctors still use much older technology.


David Sinclair mentioned in his book that doctors just treat with what works for most people most of the time. But for others, this treatment might make things worse. We have accessible technology to do much better, but doctors still stick to older technology.
