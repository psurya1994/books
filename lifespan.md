- There is one cause of one aging: ____
- Immunte T-cells go around the body looking for rogue cells and kill them before they can multiply in a cancer. Cancerious cells learnt to avoid the T-cells. Immunotherapy bings protiens to the cancer cells so that they can be detected.
- Until recently, we thought cancer was untreatble. But we've invented immunotherapy that changed everything. Aging is similar but a much easier problem to solve. 
- There is no unified theory for aging. One common theory is that because 
DNA has more and more mutations over time, we mutate ourselves into oblivion. 
- Free radicals damage DNA through oxidation. Anti-oxidant rich diet's positive health effects are because they stimulate body's natural anti-aging process by boosting the enzymes for eliminatiing the free radicals. 
- Recent study: increase in free radical production did not reduce the lifespan of mice. This suggests that mutation is not the primary cause of aging.
- David's theory: aging can be explained by the loss of genetic information. Two types of information: digital (T,C,G of DNA), analog (epigenome: heritable traits that aren't transmitted by genetic means -- stored in chromatin). 
- Analog information is more unstable and degrades more easily. 
- Dozens of "logevity / vitality" genes are discovered by scientists. They decide how much protiens and chemicals to release into the bloodstream. 
- Sirtuin geners: SIRT1 to SIRT7 -- at the forefront of medical research. They remove acetyl tags from histones and protiens, and change the packaging of the DNA. They control health, fitness. They require a molecule called NAD. The loss of NAD might be the reason why we get sick when we're old but not when we're young. 
- Siruins can buckle down in times of stress ot avoid disease. Boosting NAD has +ve benefits in mice, it helps them stay fit irrespective of what they eat.
- Other genes: TOR (similar function as Siruins), AMPK (responds to low energy levels)
- What activate longevity genes: exercise, intermittent fasting, low-protien diets, exposure to hot and cold temperatures. 

The Demented Pianist
- "Youth → broken DNA → genome instability → disruption of DNA packaging and gene regulation (the epigenome) → loss of cell identity → cellular senescence → disease → death."
- Epigenetic changes cause aging.  Genetic forces are surprisingly low: 10-25%. 
- epigenome: thje control system that tells the cell which geneous should turn on and which should remain off. 
- SIR2 reduced aging in yeast. 
- DNA changes with again. Specifically, it develops ERCs (circular patterns on it's surface). As ERCs increase, aging get worse. 
- Feeding less sugar to yeast cells slows down a lot of the aging process. 
- SIR recovers DNA damage. 
- Sirtuins generally focus on regulating genes. But when there's DNA damage, they go to fix the DNA before returning back to their normal function. 
- If there's too many emergencies to repair DNA, some of the basic cell functions such as reproduction is not done. This alters the epigenome is ways never intended. 
- David tested these theories on the mouse and confirmed that they work.
