Introduction:
- Goal was to get poor countries energy / electricity. Fossil fuels are cheaper than renewable sources to generate electricity. It is unfair to ask poor countries to use only renewable sources. So the only plausible way our seems to be having breakthroughs in renewable energy so that it's cheaper than the alternatives.
- Complications: Wind doesn't always blow. Sun always doesn't shine. And storing large amounts of energy in batteries is inefficient. 
- We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We emit 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases. COVID reduced it by just 5% in 2020. So just flying less won't be enough, we need technological breakthroughs. "we need put the world's scientific IQ into deploying green energy solutions"

Why zero?
- greenhouse gases trap heat and make the temperature go up. they stay in the air for a very long time. 
- when we dig up coal, oil or natural gas and burn them, we emit carbon into the atmosphere. 
- methane is worse than CO2.
- greenhouse gases absorb a specific wavelength of radiation, which happens to be the same wavelength that the earth reflects from sun. 
- we'll get to 1.5-3 degrees in mid-century and 4-8 degrees by end of century
- more intense storms happen because of heating (because more water vapor is evaporated leading to more intense thunderstorms)
- poor countries will be affected more by climate (bangladesh)
- climate change: yeilds of crops reduce. make animals less productive. especially bad for the poorest 1 billion.
- 2 degress is not 33% worse than 1.5 degress, it can be twice as worse. 
- we need to adapt + mitigate, with more focus on mitigation

This will be hard
- fossil fuels account for 60% of the electicity in rich countries. fossil fuels are very cheap, they're ubiqitous.
- developing countries will start using more and more fossil fuels to develop. 
- making fast progress is hard (unlike how we did in computing). fuel economy has only gotten three times more efficient in the last 100 years. solar panels were 15% efficient when invented, 25% efficient now. 
- our laws and regulations are outdated. governments change, funding is unstable for clean energy projects. 
- unless we move to 0 fast, bad things will happen in people's lifetime and very bad things will happen in a generation.
- it's not like we can just add more windmills and solar panels to solve the problem, we need new technology. 
- global cooperation is hard. 

Five questions:
- how much will this change reduce the 51 billion tons?
- be clear on what activities generate how much greenhouse gases. cement-steel-plastic: 31%, electricity 27%, growing animals & plants 19%, transportation 16%, cooling 7%
