The Art of War is a powerful text that elucides principles that help one win a war. Why is this important in the present day where war is no longer a concern? It is because these principles are transferable and can be applied to everyday lives. For example, if you're competing with someone in a competition, how much of your preparation strategy do you share with them? The book helps us think more clearly about it. It also gives us an important framework to derive principles of living in the present world to live a good life for an individual and the culture to develop if one is building a company. 

The principle can directly be applied if you're playing games like age of empires. Should be fun applying these principles while playing a multiplayer game with friends.
