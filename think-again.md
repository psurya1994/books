Summary:
It's a nice book, my key takeaways are (i) rethinking helps (if you're chaning your opinion often, it's a good sign) and is critical to growth, (ii) if you want someone to change opinion, just ask questions and give them time to think, (iii) have confident humility (belief that you will figure out the right thing, not that you have already figured it out). Interesting ideas, but not super novel. 

Prolougue: 
- Rethinking and unlearning is just as imporatance as learning and thinking.
- Generally, people who change answers score more in tests (avoiding first instinct fallacy).
- We cling tightly to our instincts, and don't update them even in light of new evidence. 
- Anchor your sense of self in flexibility instead of consistency.

Chapter 1:
- People (and organizations) who rapdily update their beliefs succeed in adapting to a world with new evidence and data all the time. 
- We typically keep switching between: preaching (protect our ideals), prosecutor (attach other's beliefs), politician (try to win audience for our beliefs).
- Especially for scientists, it's imporatnat to change your intuitions based on new papers in the area. 
- Thinking like a scientist is life is the solution. 
- Entreprenuers trained to think like scientists (strategy is a theory, customer interviews help develop hypothesis, MVP test the hypothesis). Rigorously test and make decisions based on if the hypothesis is accepted or rejected. 
	- made 12k$ per year as opposed to 300$ per year control
	- pivoted twice more often
	- Decisiveness is overrated. Just try things out and refine based on the results.
- Example failure: Mike at Blackberry had initial success with encryption and keyboard. Even though iPhone came out, he was  slow to chage his mind as the CEO which led to the demise of the company. He strongly though having an internet browser on phone would drain the battery. He wasn't open to changing his mind. 
- Being mentally smart like Mark is not enough. You need to be able to rethink. 
- Evidence: high IQ -> more vulnerable to stereotypes, smarter -> harder to update your beliefs. 
- Even experts in fields fail to analyse gun data impartially. Their political affliation makes them vulnerable to confirmation and desirability biases. And smart people on top have the "I'm not biased" bias.
- Evidence suggests that intellectual curiosity and openness makes people successful across all areas: from scientists to presidents.
- Step 1 is to recognize where we don't know much. Intellectual humility. Know what we don't know. 
- Example: Steve Jobs didn't believe in the mobile phone. It's their team that convinced him, and he was open enough to change his mind. 
- My thoughts:
	- This extends into all areas of life. My belief that meditation helps, that going after fame makes life miserable, that Stoicism says something valuable about life, etc., I need to be more flexible in keeping these beliefs and have to be excited about changing my opinion.

Chapter 2:
- People good at their work are less confident than people who know less. 
- We need to correct for our cognitive blindspots. One of the biggest of them is the imposter syndrome. On the other extreme, we have armchair quaterback where you're confident about something you don't know a lot about. 
- Managers tend to overestimate their abilities. Maybe over estimating is part of what makes them take up leadership roles. 
- People who overestimate their skills don't learn much and don't update their beliefs in light of new evidence. 
- You can be confident, while at the same time the humility to question if you're doing the right thing. That's the sweet spot we have to find. 
	- Confidence: "belief in yourself"
	- Humility: "questioning if you have the right tools in the present"
- Admit that you don't know something, but have the confidence that you can achieve it if you put yout mind to it. 
- Sometimes imposter syndrome can be good. Smart people are more likely to have it. Evidence show that having the doubts about themselves actually drives people to become smarter. 
- Doctors who are more confident tend to give wrong diagnosis because they feel they got everything figured out before listening properly. 
- Three benefits of doubting yourself:
	- motivates us to work harder (confidence makes people complacent)
	- motivates us to work smarter
	- makes us better learners and listeners, seeking out more evidence.
- It's okay to let confidence build slowly as we build our skills.

Chapter 3
- There are some people who enjoy having their views challenged.
- The goal is not to be right more often. It is to admit and correct each time we're wrong. 
- Being wrong isn't a bad thing, it's an opportunitiy for us to learn something new. 
- Actively look for opinions that change your mind and feel happy about them. 
- Don't poke hole when you hear conflict evidence. Accept it, and say that's very interesting. How can that be explained in my worldview?
- Keep changing your worldviews. Don't have unconditional love for anything. 
- Two kinds of detachments: detach ideas from identity, detach present from past. 
- Poll forecasters who make the best predictions are the ones who update their beliefs the most. 
- Make fun of yourself for making mistakes. Be light hearted about them. 
- Apologize for your mistakes even when the stakes are high. That's what gets you respect.
- Scientists who admit failures in their previous papers are more likely to be respected.

Chapter 4:
- Teams thrive when they have high task conflict but not relationship conflict. 
- Having a challenge networks helps as they activate rethinking cycles. Disagreeable people form a good fit for such a network. Adam Grant got his network to tear down each chapter of his book.

Chapter 5: Changing people's minds
- When you're watching a debate, it's a good sign if you're changing your time as you hear new arguments. 
- A weak point generally dilutes more good points. Stick to only few good points.
- Instead of going on offense and defense, they say "don't you see any merit in this proposal at all"? By asking more questions, you appear less asseritve. 
- Listen to the other person and give them a lot of credit for it. Stealman to learn. Understand before seeking to be understood.
- Single line of argument feels like a converstion, multiple sounds like an onslaught and make people unwilling to change their mind.
- The people most likely to change one's mind is themselves. Give people autonomy by asking questions. 
- Nice question to ask: what evidence would change your mind? This helps them be more precise about what they're saying.
- Even if the other person is angry, just hold back and ask questions. 
- Polarization is intensified by confirmity.
- Reflecting on the arbitrariness (counterfactual thinking: what beliefs would you have if you were brough up in a different environment) can help break stereotypes of people. 
- Plant a seed of doubt and give people time to think about it.
- Interview pickup lines: I'm probably not the candidate you’ve been envisioning. I don’t have a decade of experience as a Product Manager nor am I a Certified Financial Planner. But what I do have are skills that can’t be taught. I take ownership of projects far beyond my pay grade and what is in my defined scope of responsibilities. I don’t wait for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what needs to be done. I invest myself deeply in my projects and it shows in everything I do, from my projects at work to my projects that I undertake on my own time at night. I’m entrepreneurial, I get things done, and I know I would make an excellent right hand for the co-founder leading this project. I love breaking new ground and starting with a blank slate.

Chapter 7:
- If you want to change a person's mind: ask questions and listen. 
- Phrases to use: 
	- "whether you chose to vaccinate or not, I respected your decision as someone who wants the best for your kids."
	- "here are a few things that worked for me, do you think any of them might work for you?"
	- "I have a lot of respect for people like you who stand by their principles"
	- "I'd love to hear why ()"
	- "Have you considered ()"
- Present information only when people ask for it.

Chapter 8, 9:
- Just breaking filter bubbles and knowing the other side exists isn't enough to change our minds. Looking at the issue as shades of grey instead of black and white helps. 
- When experts express doubts, they become more authoritative. 
- Active learning helps.
- Embrace confusion. 

Chapter 10:
- Just because some strategy has worked before doesn't mean it is right. If soemthing doesn't seem right, spend more time rethinking (like how people analyse airplane crashes)
- Having psychologically safe team where people can openly acknowledge their mistakes. Such a learning culture can be critical to challenge you beliefs. 
- When people say that they found some issue and it was because of reason X, asking "how do you know?" can help.
- Don't take yourself too seriously, laugh at funny destructive criticisms of you.

Conclusion: 
- For kids, focusing on "doing science" keeps them more motivated than being scientists. We can all do science. 
- People who are more certain about their career in their 20s are the ones who are most uncertain in their 30s.
- We should be ready of update our beliefs of who our partners are. 
- They more people care about happiness, the less happy they are with their lives. 
	-	My thoughts: I disagree, it's probably people who have a narrow definition of happiness. The way I'm using the term, Buddist monk are looking for happiness.
- Look for jobs where we learn and contribute, instead of jobs that make us happy (in a 1-2 year window, it's hard to look too far ahead). 
- Question what we do daily. We don't have to be limited by who we have been in the past. 
	- My thoughts: the thought experiment of imagining that we were all created last thursday is a useful framework here. If has a memory loss, and we were told that we were a different kind of person, we would change instantly (that's my hypothesis) and taking on this new persons identity.
