This is the first serious book on diet that I read (I trusted it because it was recommended by Firas Zahabi). I've made multiple changes to my eating routines based on the suggestion in this book as I was reading it. In essence, the book suggests to move toward nutritent dense foods such as greens, dry fruits, beans, lentils, etc., I've made many of these changes to my routine and excited to see how I will feel in it.

Chapter 1: Background
- Fluctuating weight is worse than having a stable weight. This is what's wrong with extreme diets. 
- Just follow the diet plan here, and let Dr. Joel Furhman call the shots. In a week, magic will begin.
- Eat nutrient dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, and seeds.

Chapter 2: Introduction
- Nutrient density of your food. Health = Nutrients / Calories. 
	- When this is high, fat melts away and health is restored. 
	- It helps supress "toxic hunger" cravings.
- People following this diet lose 20 pounds within first 6 weeks and rid themselves of a wide range of diseases such as allergies, asthma, acne, headaches, high blood pressure, diabetes, reflux esophagitis, lupus, kidney insufficiency, psoriasis, angina, cardiomyopathy, osteoarthritis, and multiple sclerosis; and obviate the need for prescription drugs.
- BMI of 25 is considered healthy by NIH. This is inaccurate, according to the data it is 22.5!
- “Your risk of a heart attack and/or stroke will almost disappear, and your risk of cancer can plummet by more than 90 percent, while your life expectancy can increase by twenty years. ”
- Absolute calories don't matter as long as you're eating nutrient dense foods.

Chapter 3: Toxic Hunger
- In SAD, 55% of calories are from processed foods and 30% from animal products -- both of which lack essential nutrients.  Diet centered on milk, cheese, pasta, bread, fried foods, and sugar-filled snacks and drinks is bad for health.
- Unhealthy food is addictive. 60-80% of the population suffers from it. We're addicted to food because of toxic hunger. 
- When we eat low nutrient density, cells become congested with toxins such as free radicals and AGEs. These lead inflammation and cell damage. 
- Two phases of digestive cycle: 
	- anabolic: when you're eating / actively digesting, the process of detoxification is minimal
	- catabolic: detoxification is reved up. symptoms might be interpreted as hunger. people eating frequently avoid this phase. 
- normal hunger: when body burned most of the fuel from previous meal, toxic hunger: when body is in catabolic state.
- toxic hunger can be avoided by eating nutrient dense foods. high-nutrient, low-calorie density—foods such as raw vegetables, fruits, beans, onions, and mushrooms
- emotional eating makes you feel worse.
- Three habits of health: 
	- nutrition: only eat foods that are rich in nutrients
	- exercise: be active regularly.
	- positive mindset: more love and care of others in your life

Chapter 3: Diet Myths exposed
- Selective perception: using scientific data to validate your beliefs and ignoring data that challenge them. Doctors and celebrity nutritionalists often promote falsehoods.
- Micromanaging the amount of fat-carb-protien ratio doesn't help that much.
- Diets that fail to address nutritional quality fail to make any real dent in weight loss or other health parameters. 
- Three irrefutable facts about food:
	- veggies, beans, seeds, fruits and nuts are good
	- excessive amounts of meat or animal products cause disease
	- minimizing refined carbs is good 
- Food choices:
	- Vegetable oils (including olive, coconut, soybean oils) have a lot of empty calories and the suspected carcinogen monochloropropane. It is converted into fat very efficiently. 
	- Pasta and white bread are poor sources of minerals, rapidly converted to body fat. 
	- Refined foods don't have fiber or micronutrients. 
	- Empty calories are the worst. 
	- Unrefined plant foods must supply the vast majority of calories for any diet to be safe.
	- Natural plants, such as vegetables and beans / lentils, contain thousands of protective micronutrients, including antioxidants and phytochemicals.
	- Consuming animal protien increases IGF-1: it accelerates aging process and cancer. Protien rich plant foods such as seeds, beans and greens don't have this issue. The science is clear on this. 
		- Low carb, high animal protien diets are risky. The more the animal protien, the higher the risk.
		- Have less than 5% animal protien everyday.
	- Walnuts are super beneficial. 
	- Nuts have better fats than oils because they are more slowly absorbed. 
	- Take fish oil supplements: 200mg of EPA and DHA if you don't eat fatty fish (not eating fatty fish is healthy). 
- Wheat 
	- It is bad when refined (white flour) as it spikes insulin ue to high glycemic index. 
	- Whole wheat has a much smaller glycemic index (it could be dangerous to people who are allegric to gluten). 
- People in the paleo community argue that saturated fat is okay. But multiple randomized controlled trials show that it is not. 
- Excess body weight (stored as fat) is the primary reason for poor health. 
- Overweight or not, SAD is unhealthy. It's possible that undiagnosed illnesses are what are leading to a lower weight. 
- Calorie intake needs to come with sufficient amount of protective micronutrients.
- Be relatively thin with high density of micronutrients to be healthy.
- Just eat these good foods without counting calories. 

Chapter 4: The end of dieting
- apple > apple juice (because body absorbs calories from juice much faster)
- eat three substantially sized meals everyday with the right foods. You don't need to calculate calories then.
- Make salad the main dish and eat everything else after that. 

Chapter 5: The power of real foods
- More deep science on advantages of super foods in scientific terms.
- GBOMBS: greens, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, seeds
- beans > whole wheat > refined wheat

Chapter 6: bootcamp
- more science
- animal protien increases risk of cancer, heart disease, etc., Keep animal calories to <10% of calories. 

Chapter 7: the plan
- chapter that succintly describes the action steps one could take.
- avoid tomatoes in BPA based cans.
