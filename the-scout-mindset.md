Introduction:
- What traits lead to good judgement? More than clever, intelligent, patience, etc., there' another trait that's very important but overlooked: the scout mindset. 
- Scout mindset: the motivation to see things as they are, not as you wish they were.
- Knowing how to reason / see flaws in arguments don't help people in thinking better, unless they're able to see flaws in their own arguments.
- How to get that mindset?
	- #1: realize that truth isn't in conflict with other goals
		- myth: seeing the world realistically leads to depression
		- myth: you must be delusionally overconfident to start a company (many famous founders actually expected their companies to fail)
	- #2: learn tools that make thinking easier to see
	- #3: appretiate the emotional rewards of scout mindset
		- make you psychologically much freer

Chapter 1: two types of thinking
- Motivated reasoning: When we have a strong belief, we seek evidence that supports this and ignore / reason out evidence that goes against. (solider mindset: trying to defend our beliefs)
- It's easy to spot in other people, but it doesn't feel like motivated reasoning for us internally. But unconsciously, we're protecting our beliefs and engaging int MR.
- Accuracy motivated reasoning: we seek to find out what's true, irrespective of how it impacts us. (scout mindset: wants to create a map of what's really out there, even though he has internal preferences)
- Scouts know that maps are approximations of reality (and they could be completely wrong when new evidence comes up). They're open to updating the map as they get new information.
- Scouts think ahead of time about all the things in which the plan could fail. 
- Scouts invite other people to tell the truth even if it's painful. 
- We keep switching between scouts and soldiers based on context. 

Chapter 2: soldier mindset
- what function does motivated reasoning serve? First three are deception of ourselves, next three are deception of other people.
	- comfort: 
		- denying the reality temporarily feels good
		- eg. I'm going to give up, I won't be able to get my grades up no matter how hard I try
	- self-esteem: feeling good about ourselves
		- to protect our egos and feel good about ourselves
		- eg. messy desk is a sign of creativity, you can't be successful like me unless you up in the same amount of work, etc.
		- students with lower grades change their beliefs: grades are not important overall.
	- morale: motivating ourselves to do hard things
		- most people think P(startup success) for their company is >70%, even though the baseline is 10%.
		- focus on reasons why company could work, instead of why it might fail
	- persuasion: convincing others so that we can convince ourselves
		- lawyers, academics, etc. 
		- we want people around us to believe that: I'm a good person, I'm disciplines, I work hard, etc.
	- image: choosing beliefs that make us look god
		- What kinds of person would believe a claim like this, and is that how I want other people to see me?
	- belonging: fitting in your social group
		- ignoring evidence to not change your belief against your group norms.
- Learn about cognitive biases doesn't fix why we do motivated reasoning. We need to be able to clearly see what's motivating our reasoning in ourselves.


Chapter 3: why truth is more valuable than we realize
- In soldier mindset, we ask "can I believe it?" about things we want to accept and "must I believe it?" about things we want to reject.
	- Motivation: comfort, self-esteem, morale, persuation, image, belonging
- In scout mindset, our thinking is guided by "should I believe it?"
	- Motivation: make good judgement calls about which problems are worth fixing, which risks are worth taking, how to pursue our goals, who to trust, etc.
- soldier mindset vs scout mindset -- they have tradeoffs and we do this tradeoffs unconsciously.
- It's reasonable to be rationally irrational. Which is consciouslly deciding that being irrational is important to get us to do necessary things.  
- We unconsciously overvalue soldier mindset and undervalue scount.
	- short-term bias: we prefer sleeping in, rather than working out
	- The benefits of scout mindset are not just for the present decision you're taking, but it's good in the long term to develop this habit and this improves every decision you make by making this a habit.
- We underestimate the effects of self-deception
	- when you tell a lie, it's hard to tell what you've committed yourself to 
	- lies we tell ourselves (through motivated reasoning affect us too); eg. you might think you're smarter than you are, but what happens when you score less on an exam? you'll have to come up with a new reason to explain that. This causes ripple effects through your map of reality.
	- This is alarming, we need to compensate for this by ysing hte scout mindset.
- We overestimate social costs
	- eg. you lie to the doctor about taking you medication to get his approval, rather than contempt. rationally, this judgment of the doctor doesn't mean anything and you're better off telling the truth: you get the best medical advice.
	- making a fool of yourself feels a lot more significant than it actually is
	- our instinct is to take the soldier mindset, we need to actively compensate for that and make this a habit
	- we overestimate the costs of social disapproval
- An accurate map is more useful now
	- we have many more options right now, more opportunities, etc. Deciding which problems in life we want to solve, and which are worth solving is a matter of judgment. We take many more decisions now, and scout mindset helps improve our judgment on each of these things.
	- Seeing clearly is important for the long-term decisions we make 

Chapter 4: signs of a scout
- Main roadblock for being in scout mindset: believing that we're already in it. You tend to think your judgment is superior because you're using the scout mindset
- Being smart and knowledgeable doesn't make you a scout
	- As knowledge / education / scientific literacy increases, convervatives are less likely to believe in climate change and liberals are more likely. This shows that motivated reasoning is playing a role here: not just the raw evidence.
	- As people become smarter their opinions diverge based on their political stance. 
- If you're a scout, you should be able to pinpoint concerte examples where you used that mindset.
- 5 signs of scout mindset
	- Do you tell other people when you realize they were right? "You were right and I was wrong."
	- How do you react to personal criticism?
		- Examples of criticism that you used to improve yourself. Do you  go out of your way to seek criticism, and make it easier for others to do so?
	- Do you ever prove yourself wrong?
	- Do you take precautions to avoid fooling yourself?
	- Do you have any good critics? 
	- Can you recognize yourself being in scout mindset?

Chapter 5: Noticing bias
- To notice bias, run counterfactual thought experiments. There are 5 types of thought experiments that you can run.
- #1: the double standard test
	- Am I judging other people by the standard I wouldn't apply to myself? 
	- Sometimes you also judge yourself more harshly, for example, imagine how you would feel if someone else in the class asked a stupid question -> it wouldn't be a big deal.
- #2: the outsider test
	- What would you do, if you haven't already invested so much into this?
- #3: the conformity test
	- Would you defend your views, even if the other person tells you he doesn't hold it anymore?
	- When someone convinces you of something, be wary that they might say "I was just playing devils advocate, this doesn't make sense". So build opinions by yourself.
	- Would you still have kids in a world where only 30% of hte people had kids?  
- #4: selective skeptic test
	- Imagine this evidence supported the opposing side, how credible would you find it?
- #5: status quo bias test
	- If you current decision is not the status quo, would you still make it?

Chapter 6: How sure are you?
- We have unreasonable certainity about our beliefs. As scouts, we'd want to think in shades of grey and give probability value to our beliefs.
- If you're so sure about somehting, think about how much money you're willing to bet

Chapter 7: Coping with reality
- In critical situations, people have wishful thinking / do motivated reasoning to deny reality. But this is when it's the most important to be in touch with reality. 
- People use motivated reasoning to be motivated in light of lots of rejections. But there's a better way. "Yes, I'm not a good sales person, but I am getting better at it" or "If I continue to keep working at it, there's no reason why I can't be the best" -- use a more honest reasoning
- You've given your best, so the outcome doesn't matter -- use that mindset in uncertain situations
- When we're feeling bad, use coping strategies that are honest, instead of wishful thinking.
	- you can use gratitude to not feel too distraught
- Conceding your ground in arugments, increases your reliablity credulity.

Chapter 8: motivation without self-deception
- "self-belief" model of success: if you convince yourself that you'll succeed, you'll be motivated in adverse situations, and eventually succed. 
- But is it a good thing to be irratiionally optimistic about your chances of success?
- If you want to succeed, see which path you can pursue where you have a higher likelihood of success; instead of delusionally following one path.
- Be rationally optimistic, try to judge the odds accurately and then take the decision. Accurately seeing the odds gives us a better bigger picture, and possibly better paths to follow.
- Accurate picture of the odds helps you judge how much to stake on success. 
- Be motivated by "this is a bet worth taking" instead of "this will work"
