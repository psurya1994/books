Keys to mastery: 
- What leads to mastery? Is it talent? But there are many examples where people are not smart (below average intelligence) when they're young but go on to do great things. What they have differently is a passion, and the bravery to follow it.
- The desire to learn / inclination is good enough to be incredibly good at something. This inclination helps them get over all the adversity in the process. 
- Patience, persistence and confidence play a much bigger role than talent.
- Our intuition is to blame externals, and act as if things out of your control are resposible for one's mastery. This helps you justify your actions of being lazy. 
- Your actions determine your mental state. You're a motivated person not because of your genetics but because of your previous actions in life that helps you cultivate this motivation.
- This book is a toolkit for you to carve your way to mastery. 

Discover your life's calling
- You have an inner force inside of yourself that drives you to do something specific. Learn who you really are, and align yourself with in. That will put you on the path to mastery. 
- The small ideas you have about things in the passing, think through them, and pursue them further. These ideas that come from within, are much more powerful than the ideas you get from outside. You'll have much more passion to pursue these ideas.
- Go where these ideas lead you. You will do novel things that no one has ever done before. You will come up with new ways of doing things. It's okay to be slow. Don't worry about the outcome. Just do the thing that the inner force guides you towards. 
- Q: what is this force in my case?
	- I have many interests that my mind pushes me towards, let me list them here: implementing cool ML applications, desire to learn new things, read books, make videos explaining complex things simply, create intuitions for various concepts, build things, understanding human suffering, why people disagree, best ways to convince something in arguments, etc.
- When we follow our inclinations, it's easy to get into flow. 
- Environment generally pushes us against pursuing this inner force which leads to an unsatisfying life. 
- To do work for money, and live our life waiting for non work time is a depressing way to live. 
- See this journey as twist and turns, rather than the straight path. Don't start with something ambitious, start with something that you kinda like. And then switch to a related field that you like more. Continue this till the end. 
- "Take what you do for others, and make it your own" At some point, you'll have enough mastery to pursue an independent path.

Strategy for finding your life task:
- Return to your origin: what are things that enjoyed more when you were younger? pursue them. also try new things.
- Occupy the perfect niche. It will utimately fit into soemthing that the world wants. This way you don't have to compete with others, and just work at your own pace. You can pursue multiple niches and connect them together.
- Avoid the false path: rebellion strategy. Something we're attracted to for money, fame or attention. It's the external force that's driving you there, not your internal. 
- Let go of the past. Keep pursuing the thing you like on the side. Don't be committed to your career or company, be committed to pursue your passion. 
- Find your way back. 
- Reversal. Some people only find things that they're unsuccessful when they look back. But still do simple things, stick to the process.
- People who learn quick and easily face setbacks later in life: because they don't learn the importance of diligence and focus.

The first transformation:
- Learn the lessons and follow the paths established by the masters. In the process, you'll learn to become an independent thinker.
- Ideas can take years to develop. Let them happen naturally. 
- People take 5-10 years to develop quitely, this is not seen from the outside. 
- We need to learn from masters (and use them as guidelines for our life). 
- "You must choose places of work that offer the greatest possibility for learning" -- this will pay you dividends for decades to come, far more the your current raise in pay. Don't pick the path that's easy and comfortable, because you won't have much leanring. 
- In the apprenticeship phase (when you're still learning), there are three steps:
	- observation (passive mode)
	- skills acquisition (practice mode)
	- experimentation (active mode)
- The passive mode: (obersve and analyse)
	- Observe and absorb the reality as deeply as possible (analogous to prediction in RL)
	- Avoid the urge to get attention, impressing people or proving yourself! 
	- Only impress people with the seriousness of your desire to learn, not because you want to raise to the top before you're ready.
	- Be like an anthropologist and learn about the work culture, and who's what. Don't try to change anything, you will be killed. You can do that after you become a master.
	- After a lot of observation, start to analyse things. Why are thigns a specific way? Just fit in initially to avoid unneccesary troubles.
	- My takeaways: I have the urge to impress my boss by building cool things quickly. I need to stop that. I need to instead focus on learning and understanding. 
- The practice mode:
	- Do endless repetition of the masters. Learn to replicate what the masters do without making mistakes. Spend 10,000 hours doing this. Watch and imitate; rather than hear verbal instruction. 
	- Master only one skill at a time. The pain and boredom while doing this toughens our mind just like exercise. Pain is good, don't get distracted or look for shortcuts. 
	- We're teaching things to our lizard brain as we do this. This cannot happen if we're moving to different tasks. We need to stick to one for long periods of time. 
	- Understand your inadequacies and absorb them fully. 
	- Takeaways:
		- Look at good codebases, and understand every line of it. For VSR.
- Active mode:
	- This is the shortest part of the process. Take on new project. To help you gauge the skill gaps in your knowledge. 
	- Put the ideas out there, and listen to the criticisms. 
	- Try this before you're ready. 
	- If you're doing this well, move to a complimentary area to build new skills. 
	- The future belongs to those who acquire more skills and have novel ways of combining them. 
	- Focus more on building things, than talking high level about ideas. Work with your hands. 

Strategies for ideal apprenticeship:
- Let's see what strategies masters of the past used to pursue thier ideal aprenticeship.
- #1: value learning over money
	- See how top authors write and immitate their style. You need to immitate if you want to get good.
	- Just reading a lot of patent can get you to be the top thinker (eg. Albert Einestein), it sharpens your reasoning power.
	- Keep your main career that you do for living (and is not inline with your inner force) to a minimium. Spend minimal possible hours on it, and spend most of the time on your personal development. 
	- When you're doing a high paying job, you'll feel the please of impressing your boss that you're worth that pay, instead of acquiring skills. Mistakes are too costly. Eventually, time will catchup with you if you're not learnign. 
	- Only pick the job that gives you the most opportunity to learn. 
- #2: keep expanding your horizon
	- you can do this by reading books.
	- you can do this by listening to the experts, going to meetings. 
	- all of these would come together, when you're building your masterpeice.
	- don't accept your status and limited expose. learn whatever you can get your hands on.
- #3: revert to feeling of inferiority
	- we feel smug / superior when we come across unknown viewpoints. this detriorates the learning process.
	- always feel that others know much more than you, and that you're dependent on them to navigate the world. 
- #4: trust the process
	- remember to all the past sitatuation where you amde massive progress by working. trust the process, it works. don't trust the outcome, don't rely on the outcome.
	- put that extra 1% in, take those extra opprtunities to get in your 10,000 hours. 
	- a common failing point for people is that they grow frustrated, insecure, bored and give up when they don't seem to make progress. 
- #5: Move toward resistance and pain
	- Stick religious to the schedule. Create the schedule based on your own understanding and follow it. If others make it for you, it won't be as motivating. 
	- Create your own custom curriculum for skills, and give yourself a certificate on passing it. Deconstruct the skills and create your own training regimens. 
	- Keep practicing the skill. If you want to become a better writer, just write anything. Then compare what you've written to what other people have and think about how you can improve. 
	- Don't perform the standard exercises accepted by other people. Create your own regimen and justify it for yourself. 
	- Give yourself unreasonable deadlines to practice the skill.
	- Takeaways: In my case, I need to create lots of YouTube videos of poor quality, and critique myself by comparing what I'm doing to what other people are doing. Only by writing these comment will I improve. 

Ideas:
- The first step towards making progress is to immitate your masters. Just immitate for now, you can get better slowly. 
- When you're forced to study for an exam that you're not interested in, what would you rather learn? That can give you insights into the life you might want to live.
