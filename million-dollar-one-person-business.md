Introduction:
- Companies are looking for young people more often. Later in people's career, the demand is not that high. So many people might do better building their own businesses rather than going up the career ladder.
- One peron businesses are very common.

Chapter 1:
- The business are in the following categories: e-commerce, manufacturing, informational content creation, consultant services, personal service firms, real estate. 
- It is possible and people are doing it, just start and experiment. You will figure it out inevitably.

Chapter 2:
- You need to outsource things to build a 1mil$ business. You can't do everything: use shopify to build the store, outsource manufacturing, focus on customer support.

Chapter 3: what business could you start
- you won't be able to do this in one afternoon, it will take quite sometime and experiments before something works out. 
- before starting a business, try 2500 word blog posts and see how the response is like after sharing on social media. maybe convert it into a seminar and see how many turn up. engage with a customer base, ask what they want and deliver exactly that. 
- don't aim for a high 1million$, instead focus on small goals. Say 50$ a month first. And make sure it scales well.
- housing is the biggest fixed cost, if you can cut down on housing and spend that on your business; you'll be in a much better place. Make sure you're in a place that covers health insurance to do this.
- find something you're passionate about, manufacturing is not hard -- you just outsource it to people in china
- experiment to find your niche. you never know what's going to work, it's hard to tell; you only know by running experiments and talking to customers. 
- test it on a small scale, before testing it more extensively. use shopify to setup the niche store. or you could just sell on amazon / groupon. you can easily find wholesale stores who do dropshipping. you can use google ads / facebook ads to drive people to your website.
- if no one shows up, try a different product
- start in a field of your expertise / scratch your own itch.
- Use Maker's row website to turn your ideas into products. 
- See clickbank website to see what sells well. 
- raising your fees for professional serviecs: take big clients, even if it's for free early. use those testimonials, to raise your value.
