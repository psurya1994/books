## Man's search for meaning

This is a book written by a Nazi camp survivor who is a psychologist. He talks about his experience in the camp and how people responded when put to this incredible torture.

Only people who lost as scruples in the fight to survive returned. 

Once someone lost the will the live, it seldom returned. 

Optimistic people did not return. They were disappointed repeatedly when their expectation of being home for christmas was violated. 

Insomnia (or waking up with small disturbances) was never a problem. They were able to get their few hours of sleep in very uncomfortable surrondings. 

Within the first few days, the prisoners weren't afraid of death. They're not depressed anymore, they change to apathy. People dying didn't move him anymore. All efforts were focus on preseving one's life. 

Even though they were beatean up for the smallest of reasons, it's the mental agony (regarding the injustice being done to them) was far worse than the physical pain.

The prisoners "regressed" to a more primitive live centered around food. People discussed strategies to optimally eat bread over teh course of hte day. Sexual urge was absent. 

Some men lost hope but it was the optimists who were the most irritating. 

It could help spiritual life deepen; people were able to give up material desires and find deeper meaning. 

Love seemed to be the most important emotion. 

They were so happy at how good nature is by looking at sunset. 

Gatherings and gossip were so effective that people sometimes skipped their daily portion of meals for it. 

Humor was a great weapon in the fight for self preservation. Making fun of the situation they're in and funny stories of how their habits will playout once they're back home.

They formed stronger bonds between each other. The smallest of things caused the biggest of joys. 

Everything that's not connected with the task of living and keeping friends alive lost it's value. 

They yearned solitude. 

The smallest of good things from their captors could get them to tears and give them meaning to survive. 



It is possible to be content by finding a deeper source of meaning in all this suffering, some people were able to get there. 

Each time unit, like an hour / day seemed endless where as a week seemed to pass very quickly. 

People who kept imagining the past were at a big risk. They don't appretiate the good things in the camp. They prefered to close their eyes and think about the past. Life for these people became meaningless. 

One a prisoner lost faith, it never came back. He didn't care about anything anymore. How can we respond to such a prisoner? By helping him see a why for his life. It doesn't matter what we expect from life, but what life expected from us. Our answer to life much be not in talk / meditation but in right action and right conduct. 

Life is giving you their experience for some reason. Be alive to fulfill it. It doesn't matter what you expect, life will take it's own course. So stop having expectations and focus on taking the right actions. 

The key to survival was to not resist suffering. To not have false illusions or entertain artifical optimism. 

One who knows his "why" can bear almost any "how".

What can you say to a group of people going through somethign like this? 











Why is reading this book important? Because it gives us some insights into the human nature. And could maybe help me think more clealry about different aspects of my life. For example, we can see the effects of optimism. I could apply this to my practice of meditation; if I have to meditate for a day, should I could breath or not? Maybe not counting will give me a better chance to survive.
