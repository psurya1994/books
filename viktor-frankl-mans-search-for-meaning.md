## Man's search for meaning

In this book, Viktor explains his experiences in the concentration camps and his theory of logotherapy that helps make sense of human behaviour in these extreme of situations. 

Why is reading this book important? Because it gives us some insights into the human nature. And helps think more clealry about different aspects of my life. For example, we can see the psychological effects of optimism in the context of unavoidable suffering. I could apply this to my practice of meditation; if I have to meditate for a day, should I count my breaths during the practice to make it through? Maybe not counting will give me a better chance to survive. 

The second half of the book focuses on the principles of logotherapy, which argues for the importance of meaning in people's lives which helps us get through unavoidable suffering unscathed. 

This book changed my mind on the importance and consequences of having meaning in life. The meaning that comes from work or love. This resonates with my experience where I'm able to push myself harder on my workouts where I find meaning in performing well on game day.

Sources that one can derive meaning from:
- Work: deep work, winning a competition, interesting scientific work
- Love: kids, partner, society

### Part 1 - Experiences in the camp

This is a book written by a Nazi camp survivor who is a psychologist. He talks about his experience in the camp and how people responded when put to this incredible torture.

Only people who lost as scruples in the fight to survive returned. 

Once someone lost the will the live, it seldom returned. 

Optimistic people did not return. They were disappointed repeatedly when their expectation of being home for christmas was violated. 

Insomnia (or waking up with small disturbances) was never a problem. They were able to get their few hours of sleep in very uncomfortable surrondings. 

Within the first few days, the prisoners weren't afraid of death. They're not depressed anymore, they change to apathy. People dying didn't move him anymore. All efforts were focus on preseving one's life. 

Even though they were beatean up for the smallest of reasons, it's the mental agony (regarding the injustice being done to them) was far worse than the physical pain.

The prisoners "regressed" to a more primitive live centered around food. People discussed strategies to optimally eat bread over teh course of hte day. Sexual urge was absent. 

Some men lost hope but it was the optimists who were the most irritating. 

It could help spiritual life deepen; people were able to give up material desires and find deeper meaning. 

Love seemed to be the most important emotion. 

They were so happy at how good nature is by looking at sunset. 

Gatherings and gossip were so effective that people sometimes skipped their daily portion of meals for it. 

Humor was a great weapon in the fight for self preservation. Making fun of the situation they're in and funny stories of how their habits will playout once they're back home.

They formed stronger bonds between each other. The smallest of things caused the biggest of joys. 

Everything that's not connected with the task of living and keeping friends alive lost it's value. 

They yearned solitude. 

The smallest of good things from their captors could get them to tears and give them meaning to survive. 



It is possible to be content by finding a deeper source of meaning in all this suffering, some people were able to get there. 

Each time unit, like an hour / day seemed endless where as a week seemed to pass very quickly. 

People who kept imagining the past were at a big risk. They don't appretiate the good things in the camp. They prefered to close their eyes and think about the past. Life for these people became meaningless. 

One a prisoner lost faith, it never came back. He didn't care about anything anymore. How can we respond to such a prisoner? By helping him see a why for his life. It doesn't matter what we expect from life, but what life expected from us. Our answer to life much be not in talk / meditation but in right action and right conduct. 

Life is giving you their experience for some reason. Be alive to fulfill it. It doesn't matter what you expect, life will take it's own course. So stop having expectations and focus on taking the right actions. 

The key to survival was to not resist suffering. To not have false illusions or entertain artifical optimism. 

One who knows his "why" can bear almost any "how".

What can you say to a group of people going through somethign like this? 

### Part 2 - Logotherapy

Logotherapy vs psychotherapy: considers that the man concern of a person is the fulfillment of meaning, rather than gratification of instincts and drives.

Knowing that there's meaning in life, can help people survive the worst of circumstances. 

People don't need a tensionless equilibrium state, what they need is striving and stuggling for a worthwhile goal. 

Existential stress is commong. Schopenhauer - "we are doomed to vacillate between the extremes of boredom and distress." 

Psychoanalysis much be complimented with logotherapy (giving the patient a sense of meaning) to be effective and avoid relapses.

Finding a abstract meaning of life for all situations is hard. Meaning of life changes based on the moment. 

Logotherapy "Live as if you're living for the second time, and that you acted as wrongly as you're about to act now."

Places to find meaning: (i) work, (ii) relationships, (iii) attitude towards unavoidable suffering (example, if someone's dreading the loss of a loved one, reframe the situation-- if you would have died earlier, the person would have suffered. here, you're suffering to avoid them the pain).

Imagine yourself to be a millionare when you're 80, but you don't have any deep relationships. How would you feel like? What would you say to yourself? -- helps people realize the improtance of living for a loved ones.

> when I'm 90, and I've realized that I've lived by the Stoic values of achieving tranquility and virtue, by helping the social good, how would I feel like? Something greater than ourselves seems quite important to survive that moment, the meaning to life. Relationships seem a key to it, and if your wife dies before you, you would only have kids left.  

Having pleasure as your goal is unrelaistic. You need to have goal, in pursuit of which pleasure becomes a side effect.

Anxiety can be avoided by actively seeking it. (paradoxical intention) Works for stuttering, having bad thoughts, sleeplessness (try to stay awake as long as possibel can sovle this) too. Helps kill feedback loops.

Individual humans are unpredictable. Everyone has the choice to turn into a different person at any moment, which (present) scientific tools cannot predict.

Often, drug and alcoholic addicts suffer from meaninglessness. If we use logotherapy to solve the problem of meaning, maybe that can be the gateway to less addiction in society?
