## The Productivity Game

This document lays out my takeaways from watching the videos on the channel [The Productivity Game](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC02x9yG9ZFF_VZp1VnMoptg/videos)

### The Psychology of Money

- Compound affect matters. Start investing now. Being is the game early makes you a lot richer. Invest the money for long enough so that compounding can do it's magic.

- In any 20 year period, S&P500 people make money. Low volatility assets can't outperform the stock market (high vol). Invest in the market with higher volatility, like s&P 500.

- Make tail investments: make many small investments in a diversified group of companies. Or, invest in the Russell 3000.

- acquiring liabilities vs accumulating assets.
	- assets put money in your pocket. liabilities take money out of your pocket. 
	- buying a house is a liability because it involves property tax, home insurance, maintenance costs, mortgage. buying a car is a liability.
	- investing in companies is an asset. gradually increase assets while keeping living expenses to a minimum. use an old car, live in a modest home and pay small rent. 
	- buy liabilities only when you have enough money coming from assets to cover the maintainence costs.
	- reduce expenses and increase income generating assets. 
	- focus on increasing your assets more than income generating pay checks
	- when you use assests to generate income, you also pay less in taxes. income from paycheck is taxed like crazy. 
- what are good assets to invest in?
	- businesses managed by other people. if you need to put time into it, it's a job. 
	- invest in stocks and bonds. bonds are less riskly alternatives to stocks (you loan people money and get monthly income on it) but you learn less.
	- income generating real-estate
	- royalties on products and IP
- type 1 vs type 2 investors
	- type 1: puts money in savings account or high commision mutual funds, doesn't learn to invest
	- type 2: learns about investing in start-ups, looks for investing opportunities, understands crypto. learns about economic cycles, emerging markets, business fundamentals, finance, etc., 
- you are truly wealthy when incomes from your assets can cover your living expenses. "the masure of a person's wealth is the number of days they can survive without having to work"


### The e-myth revisited

- should you ditch your employers, and start your own company? before you know it, you're putting in 14-hour days. you start hiring more people. but some day, the person you hire decides to leave, you're screwed. 

- If your business depends on you, you don't own a business -- you have a job. And it's the worst job in the world. Learn to create a product that doesn't depend on you. 

- You need to build systems to get yourself out of handling things in the business. You can do it by doing the job yourself and writing a manual in the process which other people you hire can follow. 

### The four agreements 

- The four agreements can be used to short circuit the inner judge who makes our life miserable. And achieve personal freedom.

- #1: be impeccable with you words
	- talk as if everything you say is broadcast to the world. use words carefully without judging others (helps you judge yourself less).
- #2: don't take anything personally
	- people do things because of what they are, it doesn't reflect who you are. 
	- people's judgements, hatred, etc., are a reflection of the kind of people they are internally. 
	- think "poor them" with compassion instead of "why me"
- #3: don't make assumptions
	- clarify your assumptions about other people. clarify what their needs are. 
- #4: always do your best
	- even if you fail, there's no reason to judge yourself.
	- doing best: give full attention to something without focusing on the outcomes.

### The new one minute manager

- How can you have your team perform optimally without micromanaging? Use the three strategies below

- #1: one minute goals
	- help employees set their own goals, takes one minute a week of your time.
	- "what are you hoping to complete this week? don't be afraid to stretch yourself." ... "of those goals, which one could have the largest impact? (80-20 rules)" ... "can you clarify what you exactly plan to accomplish?" ... "can you type out goals and steps and email them to me?" ... "print out the goals, and at the end of each day, ask yourself: did my actions today get me closer to completing that goal?"

- #2: one minute raisings
	- ask your employee to share their screen while working. say "it's okay, I'm just watching to see you do something right" ... "nice, you've figured out how to do XYZ! This is going to help you..." ... (give a moment to let the moment of pride wash over them) ... "Good job, ...."
	- Do this early and often initially. Praise anything that looks like progress. Don't wait till they do everything before you praise. 

- #3: one minute redirect
	- tell what's disappointing, tell how you feel about it, remind them that they are better than their mistake

### Delivering happiness 

- Building a great culture in the company is critical. Three strategies to build a great culture are below:
	- #1: Hire and fire on your values 
	- #2: Create a culture book
	- #3: Get everyone to do customer service (helps understand the end)

### How I built this

- Entrepreneurship isn't dangerous as long as you have a safety net to fall back on (eg. not having a huge debt, building useful skills)

- All you need to build a business is an open mind and passion / curiosity to solve problems. 

- Don't find a problem like solving. Find a problem that people are actually struggling with, and you're also passionate about solving. Scratch your own itch.

- Building a product is research, test and iterating. Have a good story, position yourself well without threathening the big players. 

### Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg

- do the <=30 second version of the habit everyday.
- use habit stacking. 
- celebrate after every tiny habit, be proud of it. 

### The Tools by Barry Michels and Phil Stutz

- #1: Reversal of desire
	- The moment you feel resistance to do an uncomfortable task, do the following: imagine the task as a cloud, yell bring it on, move into the cloud (say I love pain), and feel yourself getting better (say pain sets me free) 
- #2: inner authority tool
	- Don't try to hide your inner self. Embrace it. Imagine yourself performing with your vulnerable self next to you.
- #3: jeopardy
	- When you feel a desire to give into your guilty pleasure, imagine your older self on your death bed scream at you: don't waste your present moment. 

### The champion's mind by Jim Afremow

- To stand out, you need to think like a champion. Use the BEST acronym for it.

- B: believe
	- Believe that you can win. Trust your training. Train like you're number 2, as though you lost by a single point. Intense training can help you have a stronger belief. 
- E: enjoyment
	- feel grateful, use humor during the moment to reduce stress. Enjoy the moment.
- S: self-talk
	- Don't visualize the negatives. Be in the moment and focus on executing your training.
	- "right here, right now" "one good play in a row" "chop wood, carry water"
- T: toughness
	- Remain positive after setback. Have incredible bounce back stats. 

- Keep a scorecard and rate yourself on each of these areas. Just focus on improving over time.
