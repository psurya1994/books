Introduction:
- The rags to riches story of entreprenuers you see only is not true. most startups fail. 
- The success of a startup is not stocasting, it can be engineered by following the right process. 
- You need to build a full-of-bugs product, get feedback and improve based on feedback + your interpretation of the experiments you run. This is a new approach to build a startup: the lean startup.
- It contains three things: extremely fast cycle time, focus on what customer want (without asking them) and a scientific approach to making decisions. 
- MBA gives good ideas for managing big companies, but for small companies, we're still shooting in the dark. This book provides a framework for entreprenuers (people who're building a product in extreme uncertainity).

Vision

Chapter 1: Start 
- Traditionally, people tend to measure progress by: are you building the product in time without missing deadlines. The lean startup way emphasizes on: fast iteration + customer insight, huge vision and great amibution at the same time. 
- Traditionally, you build the perfect product and have all the infrastructure ready for the onslaught of customers you will get. The lean startup way, emphasizes on learning through quick iteration. It tells us which turns we need to make to head in the right direction. 

Chapter 2: define
- startup: human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainity
- lean startup: set of practices for helping entreprenues increase their odds of building a successful startup
- big companies face "the innovator dilemma": they are verygood at creating incremental improvements to existing products, but struggle to create breakthrough new products. 
- the same priniples can be applied to experiments in a big company.

Chapter 3: learn
- given that we're operating in an unknown environment, the best way to navigate it is learning through dense rewards (as opposed to sparse). 
- we need to understand what customers actually want (not what they say they want), and we can learn this through quick iteration.
- when you don't have enough datapoints, you use good stories to hide your failure. you need to make testable predicitons, and test them in a rapid way.
- validated learning: method for demonstrating progress in extreme uncertain environments.
- value vs waste: eliminate all the efforts that might be a waste (eg. fixing all bugs before release). what constitutes value, and what constitutes waste? Anythign that contributes to learning is valuable.
- work smarter, not harder. deciding where you focus your efforts, guided by quick feedback, is the key.
- see building a business as a set of experiments to run. the goal is to design experiments to achieve validated learning.

Chapter 4: experiment
- you need to fail to learn. fail fast.
- instead of asking customer for feedback, just build a initial product and see how they respond. 
- for initial tests, find the most enthusiastic customer to try it out as they're more forgiving of mistakes. 
- which features are important? you can find that out by seeing what features customers complain about in the initial versions.
