Introduction
- This book is directed towards the middle level managers. 
- The world has become much more fast paced. If you don't do it, someone else will. 
- Basic ideas: 
	- output oriented management: everyone in the org produces something.
	- work is pursed not by individuals but by teams: the output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his supervision
		- what can managers do? mangerial leverage: perform tasks that have high leverage
	- team will perform well only if each individual performs their best. can be measure by "task-relevant feedback"
	- if you want to continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your competitive advantage

Chapter 1: Basics of Production
- We need to deliver product to the client within an acceptable timeframe, competitive price (while making acceptable profit).
- Work back from the delivery deadline, to make a plan on how you're going to get multiple things together. Start with the most time consuming step / expensive step (limiting step) and work your way backwards.
- types of production operations
	- process manufacturing: activity of chaning material to suit needs
	- assembly: putting together components
	- test: verify the charaterstics of the product
- But in the real world, there might be delays. Plan your work around the new limiting step accounting for these delays. You need to also think closely about how to avoid this limiting step.

Chapter 2: Managing
- To run your operations well, you will need a set of good indicators / measurements. Focus each indicator on a specific operational goal.
- Key indicators for the breakfast factory: sales forecast, raw material inventory, condition of your equipment, manpower, quality indicator (setup customer compliant log). 
	- If you look at these everyday, you will have the potential to correct them before they cascade into worse problems.
	- Ensure you don't overcorrect for an indicator by having counter indicators.
- An effective indicator should cover the output of the work unit. If one indicator counts the quantity, another should count the quality.
- Choose reliable leading indicators so that you act when they flash.
- Make sure teams provide forecasts, and see if they're able to predict things correctly. 
- Increase productivity by changing what we work on. Work on things with higher leverage. Arrange the process flow in such a way that we have high output productivity.
- Note all steps in the flow clearly, question each step and remove the unnecessary ones.
