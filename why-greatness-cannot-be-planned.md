Preface:
- Algorithms can do amazing things without explicit objectives. Realized the same is true of life.

Chapter 1: 
- Life is full of objectives, we're sometimes slaves to our objectives. As individuals, we track scores, salary, weight, etc. As society, we track employment, crime rate, carbon emmisions. Even individual pursuits in life, such as discovering something, is seen in terms of objectives. Scientists often start with an hypothesis / research objective; and rarely with just curiosity about what will happen if we mix the two chemicals.
- The truth though is that, chasing objectives hasn't lead to the biggest discoveries in science. For instance, the vaccum tube was invented while exploring electricity, not computing. 
- Creativity is searching huge space (of ideas for scientists) to come up with novel solutions that meet a defined criterion. Chasing the gradient of an objective won't get us there. So what can we rather do? Learn about previous discoveries in this search space (it gives us a broader understanding of the landscape to think in). The previous discoveries can be seen as stepping stones in this space. 
	- As a fundamental researcher, your goal would be to find new stepping stones in this space. 
	- As a applied researcher, your goals would be to optimize specific objectives using these stepping stones. 

Chapter 2:
- Most experts get there by not directly chasing the goal. Top writers did not want to become writers since they were 20. 
- Successful people wander off from their original paths. The secret is not to stick to a specific objective but to keep changing it as data comes along.
- When you see a new stepping stone, cease it. Don't just stick to your old objective. Even though it's not a clear objective, even though it's random exploration. That's what seperates you from your peers and keeps you in a position to make novel discoveries.  
- Just like how companies pivot based on opportunities, you need to pivot too. 

Chapter 3:
- Picbreeder: users were able to find good pictures when they randomly explored. But when they wanted to discover the effiel tower, they were not able to get there. The authrs say that this is the simulation of the real world. 
- Be supple, and keep switching / abondaning objectives. 


Chapter 4: 
- The space is covered in mist. No one can predict things a few stepping stones away because it's all mist. 
- Moving along the gradient can be depective if you want to get somewhere. 
- An objective is deceptive if we have ambitious goals.
- In AI, the objective only makes sense if the agent is competent enough to solve it. If not, the objective is not useful. 
- Great invention happens when you're able to recognize that the stepping stones are set, and you just need one innovation to get things to work. Use the stepping stones that are already avaiable, and figure out the ones that can help you make the big break through.
- All the stepping stones are not created from ambitious objectives. 

Chapter 5:
- The effort spent in setting objectives, is better utlizied by finding the stepping stones for the objective.

Right, if my goal is to "get a higher image net accuracy", the author would argue that I should look at the bigger picture (and focus on using ideas from other fields of study; while exploring these fields in an *undirected* way), rather than focusing on getting incremental improvements by making small changes to current SOTA models. Did I understand that correctly?
