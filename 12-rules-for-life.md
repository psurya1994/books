## Overture: 
- Jordan did a lot of reasearch and work for initial books. This came in very handy when working on his new book decades later. This shows the importance of focusing on learning, rather than producing things quickly, just like it is explained in the book mastery. 
- So I need to keep my focus on understanding and learning, rather than trying to read as many books as I can. 

## Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back

- Animals fight for territory. Species strive for collaboration. 
- Lobsters fight in increasingly escalading levels. Once it's done, the animals settle in a social / dominance hierarchy.  The ones that end up on the top are the once with the best combination of strength, socializing with others, etc. Animals of the top of the hierarchy gets all the girls. 
- The priciple of unequal distribution: only a small % of the people produce more of the work (parkinson's principle).
- Dominance hierarchy's affect how we live life, it's hard coded into the brain. 

- At the bottom of the hierarchy, your peers judge you to be of little worth and that restricts serotonin in your brain. That makes you more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance (stress). It burns up important energy. You're more impulsive, emotional and less rational. 
- At the top, you have a lot of seratonin which keeps you calm and confident. 
- If you're depressed, first fix you circadian rythms. Positive feedback rules are generally responsible for depression. 

- If you act less confident in the world, both behaviourally and posturally, people will treat you as such which leads to a negative feedback loop making you less happy.
- Have a open strong posture to find the effects of positive feedback. Be really to challenge people to conquer your territory there. 

## Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping

- You follow the prescriptions for your dog better than yourself. 
- We have the perceived experiences of order and chaos in our lives. Our life keeps switching between the both based on events in our lives.
