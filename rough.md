Spencer's podcast #2

arguments and words
- a lot of disagreement is because people use words differently, and they trigger different aspects of the object. For some people cow ==> cow in a farm, for others it might be a calf. when people say abortion, it triggers sfocus on specific memories that skew the debate
- have a meta awareness during conversations. 
- recognize what lights people up, and ask them more questions on it. practice to do this. 
- deep converstaions generally include the experiences they've had. 
- i just had this thought, what do you think about it? 
- oh by the way, i read this really interesting thing, what do you think about it?
- periodically ask yourself, what does this person want to talk about? 
- be animated, enthusiastic. hell yea! let's go. blast yourself.
