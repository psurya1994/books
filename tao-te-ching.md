The book of the way. 

Be soft, supple. Don’t resist things that come your way, flow along with the wind.

Give up to the dao, all concepts and desires. Paradoxes on the surface, but true: The more truly solitary we are, the more compassionate we can be. The more we let go of what we love, the more present our love becomes. 

He who talks unnecessarily doesn’t know. He who knows doesn’t talk unnecessarily.

The dao that can’t be told isn’t true dao.

Concepts of good / beautiful always come with a contrast. The master acts without any of these judgments. Things appear, and he lets them appear. Things disappear, and he lets them go. When his work is done, he forgets it.

Practice not doing and everything will fall into place. 

I’m reading to add another book to my list. I’m working in hopes of getting a promotion. I’m studying to increase my knowledge. All of these are manifestations of having an ambition or desire. The master has no such thing. 

The Tao is unlimited and infinite. 

The Tao doesn’t take sides. The master doesn’t take sides. He allows whatever happens. The more you use it, the more it produces. The more you talk of it, the less you understand.

The master stays behind and is detached from all things.

In living, stay close to the ground. In thinking, keep things simple.
