## How to train your mind.

This book focuses on the importance of meditation and mindfulness from the perspective of productivity. It covered many ideas which seemed plausible and inline with my beliefs. While it hasn't changed my thinking by much, it has helped me internalize the importance of meditation better. 

What is meditation? It is basically being meta aware of what's happening. To be able to disassociate yourself from the next thought.


Ep 1:
- Chris talks about the advantages of meditation, especially from the perspective of productivity. 

- Knowledge work is hard to measure. 
- Sports: combination of physical and mental conditioning. Knowledge work is mostly mental conditioning. 
- Mindfulness meditation is best for productivity. It's just recognizing what's on your mind. When you notice the state of your mind, you're mindful.
- When we meditate, we're meta aware of what our brain is doing. This helps us not get caught up in them and running on auto pilot. 
- When we're distracted, it's because something else grabs our attention and unconsciously we start attending to something else. Mindfulness helps us notice when this happens and gives us a opportunity to pull back. We notice more quickly that we're distracted. (saves 76 minutes)
- 2: Meditation helps us work on more complex projects, it increasing working memory by more than 30%. (saves 45 minutes)
- 3: When we meditate, we teach our brain to get through with fewer hits of dopamine. (save 7 minute)
- 4: Helps with procrastination. We procrastinate because we over think. Meditation helps us see it for what it is, and navigate with better mental ease at the task at hand. Feeling averse about tasks doesn't affect when you're fully mindful (doing chores can be as good a practice of meditation as anything).
- 5: more empathy, more happier

- Meditation is good not inspite of being hard, it's good because it is hard. 
- meditation: (i) knowledge work, emotional work, autonomy work / (ii) stress, frequency of negative meditation, physical pains, etc., -- it's super effective in this environment


Ep 2:
- Chris talks about how to meditate, nothing fancy.
- The key is to not judge when you're distracted. Don't be happy when you're less distracted or sad when you're more distracted. Always be content with whatever your first person experience of hte world is.
- You can something approach a meditation session with curiosity. What thoughts will pop into my mind? Why do these pop as opposed to something else? Try to predict what general things come into your mind, etc., It can be fun this way.
- Three types: focus on breath, walking meditation, mindfulness (focus on whatever grabs your attention in the present moment, while being meta aware at every moment) (can be done while eating, drinking doing dishes, etc., -- just notice everything you feel clearly)
- It's easier to do mindfulness when you're doing tasks that are not hard (like laundry as opposed to running).
- Mindfulness -- just be fully curious about everything that you're experiencing the present moment and why you're feeling htat way.

Ep 3:
- meditation improves quality of life by reducing thought pattern loops. most thoughts don't help, they reiterate fear / anger / embarassment, etc., most negative emotions arise from the overthinknig mind. 
- day dreaming helps thought, spend 30 mins everyday witht the wandering mind. that's where you get your best ideas. 
- having a strong identity (I'm a hard worker, runner, guitarist, reader, etc.,) can be a source of misery when you don't live up to those expectations. let go of the baggage that you get from identity, and focus on doing things well in this moment.

Ep 4: making it stick
- atleast 2 minutes everyday
- meditate for more time if you have less resisitance, less time if more resistance.
- do it when you have most energy (mostly morning's)
- do things you like mindfully
- mix up style of meditation
- treat yourself when you're consistent with meditation
- helps you detach from expectations
- doing anything with full attention can be a deeply meaningful experience.
