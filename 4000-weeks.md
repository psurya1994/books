4000-weeks.md

introduction
- we only have 4000 weeks in life. time is short. nobody needs to know this. we want to do more and more, in the limited time. this time seems to speed up when you grow older.
- self help books on productivity make you get more done, but you feel more empty.
- everyone is growing more impatient because they want to get more done, this leads to unnecessary suffering
- historically, the point of being rich was so that you don't have to do much. but now that we're all rich, we find more things to do. 

the limit embracing life
- problem is not the limited time, but the the pressure we put on ourselves on how we want to use this limited time.
- in the 1900s, we never had too much to do. we currently measure progress based on how much we got done in a given timeframe. 
- task orientation: the way of living where rhythms of life organically emerge from the tasks themselves, rather than creating an abstract timeline. [not clear]
	- they never think about time (eg. kids) (also called as living in deep time)
- thinking of time as a resource leads to a modified behavior: 
	- you measure your self worth based on how you use time
	- pulls you out of the present and thinking about how you're spending your time
	- you can't feel deep time anymore
	- you can never master it, so it masters you [i disagree]
- rejecting the struggle to dominate time leads you to a much calmer life
- the author ended up being more stressed and unhappy as he was following more self help books (this is quite different from what my experience has been)
	- if only he could meet boss's demands and side project, he'd one day feel secure about career and finances
	- is it good to derive all your self worth from how good you're at work? that question never crossed the author's mind
	- we don't accept things as they are, and try to change them through action.
- struggle against the painful contraints of realtiy is what makes our life harder.
- you don't accept that you don't have time to do all the interesting things you want to do. you don't accept that you can't be good at everything you pick up. instead of accepting this reality, we push back against it. and try to do more.
- havign all control over how you manage your time seems like a good thing. but, in life, most things worth acheiving (eg. marriage, parenting, business) means that we won't have control over our time.
- work with these facts, instead of pushing against them.
- embrace that you can't do everything. pick your priorities accordingly without resentment. don't try to experience everything in life (eg. reading books, learning to fight, etc.,) because you can't; don't assume that that's the solution to your life's problems. accept life as it comes.

the efficiency trap
- we live with the fear that time is not sufficient to do everything we want ot do in life.
- even the winners in our society who have high paying jobs feel the pressue to work with "crushing intensity" to maintain their status (which now have prerequised for the way they want to live life).
- you can never feel of top of all the things you feel are important. even if you do, you'll be given more things to do.
- if you don't find a peace of mind in the present, it's unlikely that you'll find it in future. 
- the modern world give you so many interesting things to do: so there will always be a different between what you want to do and what you can do.
- we want to cram more and more experiences in our life. the bucket lists is another attempt to do this.
- having good experiences, might only make you feel open to more experiences that you want to have. there is no end.
- technology exposes us to much better possibilities (eg. OkCupid, YouTube, etc.) that you're always worried about missing out on something better.
- do not postpone the things you care about the most, because you want to do another thing and act as if you have enough time to do both
- you're garaunteed to misout on the best experiences life has to offer (because there are too many of them)
- when you make things more convinient you drain it of it's meaning (eg. buying gifts, getting concern tickets, etc.)

Facing finitude
- Any finite life is a matter of ceaselessly waying goodbye to alternative better posibilities. We're additionally constrained by decision we make in the past. - Heidegger
- Eternity is worse than limited life. It takes away all motivation to do anything.
- We happen to be alive, and there's no cosmic law that entitles us to it. It's just luck, and there's no garauntee that it'll last another day. - Cavid Cain
	- This relives us of the suffering because your kids don't sleep, or that you have to unload the dishwasher. Having these might frustration affect our happiness doesn't make sense, we're not entitled to anything.
- When we make a choice to do something, don't think about all the things we don't do. But docus on how you've had a chance to choose what to do of your life that you had never any right to expect.

Becoming a better procrastinator
- The challenge is not about how get more done, but it is rather to decide what not to do and learning to be okay with that. 
- Procrastinating is inevitable. Don't feel bad about it. 
- Three principles to avoid procrastination:
	- best strategy for finance: pay the mortgage / savings first, and spend the rest. same with work: if you want to make sure an important project is done, the only way is to do it today. don't suffle your schedule, instead clean it. reduce things on it to make way for more important things. (eg. be ready to draw for 2 hours everyday and accept the consequences)
		- protect time by scheduling meetings with yourself
	- don't try to pick too many projects, pick few and do them well. 
		- work only on 3 projects at a time. if you have to do a new one, start only after you finish one of these 3. or else completely dump 1 of the projects.
		- have measurable goals on each of these and make progress.	
	- actively avoid working on the tasks which are not top 3.
- The bad kind of procrastination: not acknowledging limitation and being paralyzed by not beign able to make notable progress. 
- why do we procrastinate on important things? because the work we do won't be as good as we want it to be
	- understand that you can't build perfect things, acknowledge that. don't let that paralyze you.
	- if you're procrastinating on something because you feel you won't do a good enough job, you can relax. because judge by the standard of your flawless imagination, you definitely won't do a good enough job. so you might as well start. 
- same with relationships: they will never be good enough for you to be sure about marriage.
- it's easy to imagine: having stellar professional success, being the best parent and partner, while dedicating time for marathons / meditation retreats. but once we start to do that, we always make trade-off and it will end up suboptimal in all.
- don't be afraid to commit to one path in life (eg. marriage) because you might lose out on other options. loss is a given, accept it. don't be anxious about it.
- in relationships, you will always settle for less than what you think you deserve. you have no other choice, and this has to please you. 
	- because searching for another partner and spending endless hours talking to them is also settling.
- settling is necessary for success. you can only be successful if you stop striving and forgo art, law to settle on martial arts. If you flip between all, you won't be successful in any. 
	- same with relationships, you need to settle with one, with all its imprefections spurning the lure of superior imaginary alternatives.
- you partner can be everything. if you want someone who's a source of stability, you can't find a source of excitement in them. 
- settle in a way that it's harder to back out (eg. marriage), to be relatively more happy. burning the bridge to a number of fantasized flawless furtures should be a source of relief, because you don't have to chase them anymore. 
	- this is backed by data from Dan Gilbert's lab
- take that action, and settle. not having choices helps psychologically. you won't regret it.

the watermelon problem:
- distraction is the key problem, that keep you away from spending time on things that really matter to you. 
- attention is seen as a resource. 
- distraction is currently cause by higher forces that don't have your best interest. the typical solution is to put in strategies / tools to protect your attention. the same problem with time arises here, you can never have complete control over your attention. 
- if you're unable to spend your attention as you like, it reduces meaning in your life. 
	- if you can't keep your attention to savor the stroll in the park, or dedicate yourself to a career; you can't be satisfied
- higher forces get you to care about things you don't want to care about. and that affects how we spend our offline time too (eg. convincing you have violent crime happens often affects how you feel, you spend time thinking about something you've read online). 
- but utimately, we're the ones who choose to use our digital devices rather than live life.

the intimate interrupter: 
- the first instinct if you want to avoid pain, is to distract yourself from it. however, the truth is the more you pay attention to it closely, the lesser pain you feel. the suffering increases only when our mind wanders. 
- the better we can keep our attention on our day to day experiences (eg. cleaning the house), we realize that the problem is our resistance to experience it. 
- when you're working and the work gets hard, you move your mind to twitter for temporary relief. we have this inner urge towards distration: that if we move attention away from the challenging and meaningful task, you'll feel better. 
	- part of the issue is that what needs to be done is uncomfortable
- but, why do we find important things uncomfortable?
	- boredom. if we are not okay with being bored, we would find it hard to accomplish much. and we are not ready to feel bored, we're not ready to accept the feelings as they come, we want to change them. 
		- the solution is to fully accept and be okay with being bored; turn more attention to it and realize that it's not really that bad
	- they don't come out as we expect

we never really have time:
- we can never relax, there will always be uncertainity about future. even if you make your flight on time, you'll be worried about the next thing on your list.
- we can't really control the past or our future. we can only control what we do in this current moment. We're spawned in this moment, with constraints from all our past and uncertainity about our future. And life is continuosly made up of moments like these. 
	- it's okay to take actions so that things end up a certain way, but if you insist that it needs to be that way, we'll always be living in anxiety because you never know if it will happen until it happens; and once it happens we're anxious about the next thing on our list.
- resolutoin: realize that you can never have certainity about the future no matter how much you plan. 
- don't try to control the future. 
- The secret "I don't mind what happens." Because of this, you don't have to be on edge trying to predict future and being nervious about it
- A plan is a thought in the present moment on how you'd like to deploy your influence over future. But the future is unde no obligation to comply.

you are here:
- when we think of time as something we "own", we tend to become obsessed with using it well. We want to use it an a means to an end, which makes it counter productive. 
- we do most things as a ground work for something else (eg. take pictures to enjoy it later, strive at work to get that promotion, etc.)
- this leads to a "when-I-finally" mindset. 
- even top end workers, do a project so that they can see the end of it instead of a means in itself. this is not good.
- especially during parenting, all we do is directed towards giving a good future for our kids. but it's not clear that this should happen in every scenario. 
- we never know when it's the final time that we're doing something. So we need to treat every experience with the same respect as if it were the final one.
- we also have an economic system that pushes us to do more. it wants us to buy more things, work more to sustain itself. 
- it is very hard to live in the present moment. 
- when you go to beautiful places, the more you want the enjoy it, the less you do. even in the present, if you have a strong desire to really enjoy something, the beauty of the experience fades off.
- trying actively to have more fun with an experience, deteriorates the experience

rediscovering rest
- leisure time feels like you're wasting time and not making progress towards your goals in this short life.
	- even if we have more leisure time now, it doesn't feel like leisure anymore. this gets worse as you get rich. because people now have more options on how they can spend their time. 
	- leisure is seen as a means to an end, instead of means itself
- people find meaning in training, only towards an end goal of running 10k; but don't feel meaning in the activity itself.
- in order to fully live, you need to give up on measuring everything you do in terms of progress on future goals. 
- "idleness aversion" is the common state now.
- as long as we strive every moment, and think that it's getting that somewhere.
- we have one of two problems: (i) we have a big goal that we want to reach, but it hasn't happened so we suffer, (ii) we reach the goal, but we have nothing else to strive for which feels like a waste.
- so do more activities that are ends in itself: eg. hike
	- things where you don't mind being bad at it / where you likely won't make money from it
- having a desire for outcome restricts freedom. freedom to pursue the futile and freedom to suck at something without caring.
- results come later, and later is always to late. most of life is spend the process with few moments spend on the results.

the impatience spiral
- we're always in a hurry (eg. traffic), but that hurry doesn't get you to the destination faster. 
- paradox: we're growing more and more impatient over time; even as technology progress. 
- reading has been harder because we can't speed it up.
- people who can't stop working are additicted, just like alcoholics. they get anxious about work, but try to push harder and get even more anxious. (this is clearly not me)
- people can sit wihtout moving, they need to do something. the world has primed them this way.

patience
- in a world where everyone's rushing to do the next thing, patience can be a super power. The ability to stay still and be okay with leisure.
- derive all satisfaction from the doing, and be patient about the outcome.
- patience is a useful skill. 
- if you want to solve problem that seem large and complicated, don't throw dart. Move slowly and understand things one by one. Focus on understanding rather than solving. You'll inevitably become a great problem solved and learn a lot along the way
- principle for patience:
	- enjoy facing problems, accept them and don't be in a hurry to push them away / solve them. 
		- believing that you can get into a state where there will be no more problems is unrealistic
	- embrace radical incrementalism. 
		- do a little everyday, instead of in one big chunk fast. stop even when you're getting a lot done, so that you're motivated to get back at it tomorrow.
		- writing, creative process is quite slow. do a bit everyday. you can do it all in a 8 hour stretch.
	- wait and stay on path.
		- in art, nothing you initially produce is going to be fully original. it takes several years of daily work to get there.

the loneliness of digial nomad
- productivity books suggest that the ideal life is in which you have full control over your time. you do what you want to do when you want to do it.
	- this degree of control comes under a cost not worth paying.
- sitting in isolation and reading books all day is definitely not going to get you happy in the long term. you need to collaborate wiht other people in your life.
- our time is something to share, not to hoard. 
- when you're older, you'll start to feel more lonely. you watch kids playing in parks, and you can't play with them. you feel bad.
- the freedom to work from anywhere, and traveling to place, means that you can't make deep connections with people who you care about the most. 
- long vactions are only fun when you can do it with other people, if you do it alone, you start to feel lonely. 
- 4-day week only works if everyone has the same holidays. if different people have vacations at different times, it makes it harder for people.
- time on feels nicer and realer when you're synchronized with others. there's a deep sense of well being when you spend vacation time synchronized with family. 
	- even synchronized moving / singing / music can lead to similar things
	- it's hard to live a good life without this synchronization
- do we want the freedom to never see your friends? living a free life might mean that you are out of sync with your friends and family. 
- let the rhythms of family life and friendships take precedence over your perfect morning routine / schedule for the week. that leads to a better life at the end. 

cosmic insignificane theory
- even top performers feel like they need to do more with their life. but when you spend a weekend in nature with friends, you realize that more of life should be that way. but we forget it and get back on the threadmill.
- with covid, we learnt new things about ourselves: we might not need to work till 6.30pm everyday, gardening is fun, etc. Let's keep these learnings once COVID starts to end and the economic system start to pull you back into your old routines. 
- what you do with your time doesn't matter that much, the universe doesn't care, you're living on rent and you cannot take anything you accumulate back with you. 
- the whole of human history has happened in 60 life times. it passes in the blink of an eye. 60 is hte number of people I invite to a party. 7 is the number of people for a weekend dinner. 
- you won't be the top coder, you won't be the best cook, you won't have lasting impact, so why bother chasing it while detriorating your quality of life in the present moment. if you don't do something, someone else will do it. from a truly cosmic view, even the iphone isn't a big deal. if it wasn't steve jobs, someone else would have eventually come up with it. 
- time runs, and before you know it, you'll die. you don't matter. but humans have a ego-centric bias. 
- focus on enjoying life in the current moment as it come. have external anchors that you might want to reach, but keep all your attention on the process and enjoy the ride.
- let go of these unrealistic definition of a life well spent.
- don't aim for the most meaningful life. aim for a modestly meaningful life at the right pace.
- refuse to hold 4000 weeks to a remarkable degree of standard on how you want to spend them, taking them as they come and accept whichever way.

The human disease
- we think we can master the time, and hence our life. so we get frustrated when we miss a signal at the intersection. 
- we're working at a job, expecting the work will get better after a promotion. we're being in a relationship, expecting that it will get better once she understands you better. but you can find a great deal more peace if you accept the way things truly are, instead of focusing your attention on how they can be different. 
- 5 years to ask yourself
	- where are you trying to feel comfort, instead of feeling discomfort? choose things that are uncomfortable and make you a better person, over ones that will crush your soul and make you feel drained.
	- are you holding yourself to impossible standards? let the standards drop and pick a few meaningful tasks and get started on them.
	- are you accepting yourself to who you are?
	- in which areas of your life are you waiting to act on?
	- what would you do, if you didn't care about outcomes?

Afterword:
- hope is to keep control outside of yourself instead of acting yourself. give up hope, and do the work.
- the apocalypse is already here, the world is already screwed, we are already screwed. we've already experienced the worse, and we're okay. this must feel liberating.

Appendix:
- Tools for embracing finitude:
	- have fixed volume on number of things you want to do and time you want to spend on them. 
	- focus on one big project, complete it before going to next one. 
	- decide what you'll not be great at in life
	- focus on what you've completed and be grateful.
	- care about the right things. you don't have to care about the biggest atrovities
	- make your phone boring
	- seek novelty in the mundane, by being mindful
	- approach relationships with curiosity, instead of seeing them as a time waste. "who is this person we're with, and how would they respond to different situations"
	- cultivate instantaneous generosity. praise more often.
	- practice doing nothing. 






my thoughts:
- I feel like several things in the book don't appply to me because working more has never burned me out; like the author suggests in the book.
- we try to save money to buy a house, and once we grow older we die and give that house to our kids. but given how high our quality of life currently is, is it so important to save money for kids (compromising on your deeper values)? I don't think so.
- if you find yourself wanting to finish the task quickly when you're doing the task, instead of throghly being involved in it, maybe you have to change something.
