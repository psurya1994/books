managing-oneself

- It is important to know one's strengths. The only way to discover it is through feedback and action: expect what will happen in 9-12 months, compare notes to reality. 
- In 2-3 years, this method will: (i) show your strengths / weaknesses, (ii) what you're doing that deprives you of the full benefits of your strengths.
- What you need to do:
	- Put yourself in positions where your strengths are produce results
	- Improve your strengths
	- Acquire skills that will help you fully realize your strengths
	- Don't spend time on things that don't directly help you realize your skills
- Be aware of how you perform. 
	- reader vs listener? do you have better conversations in speaking / writing? [I'm a reader] 
	- how do you learn? some do by writing, others do by reading / listening / talking. [writing > listening > talking > reading]
	- are you a decision maker? do you prefer to be on the sidelines and give advice to people, or are you better at making decisions [I'm better as an advisor]
	- do you perform well under stress? do you fit better in a big or small organization?
- Change your environment based on this awareness. Do not try to change yourself -- you're unlikely to succeed. Work hard to improve the way you already perform. 
- Examples:
	- Because I'm a reader, I should get people's answers on text instead of [].
	- Because I learn by writing, I should write each time I'm learning something.
	- Because I'm good as an advisor, I should continue improving at it and learning all perspectives.
	- I perform better when there's no stress, so pick the job appropriately.
- Values. 
	- Make sure your values align well with the values of the organization you work for. Not on the ethics level, but culture wise. 
	- What should the business focus on? It's a value question.
	- To be effective, your values should align with the values of the government.
	- If you don't see a clear path in the long term in the work that you're currently doing, start considering other things that you can do.
- Belonging.
	- How to decide your path? By knowing your strengths, values and performance. 
	- Successful careers are not planned from the start, they develop as you prepare for opportunities: by knowing the big 3 mentioned above. 
- Contribution.
	- Given the big 3, how can I make the most contribution? What results have to be achieved to make that difference?
	- A plan cannot be made for more than 18 months, and still be reasonable and clear. 
	- Rules for making a plan: 
		- Have ambitious but reachable goals. 
		- Have meaningful results that can be measured. 
		- Then decide on the actions that will get you there. 
- Relationships:
	- To be effective, you might have to know other people. You can learn about to big 3 for them, to understand them better. And adapt accordingly. Eg. understand if your boss is a listener or a reader; then decide on the value of writing reports.
	- Take responsibility for your role. Ask and understand the big picture. If your boss makes a mistake due to lack of knowledge, it's because of you -- you haven't helped him gain that knowledge.
- Mid life:
	- At 45, people reach their career peak, and get bored. They are very good at their job, but they don't find it challenging or take up new things. To tackle this, people:
		- take new jobs
		- develop a parallel career
		- become an entrepreneur.
	- Develop a second major interest, and develop it early.
		- Don't have all your eggs in one basket. Anything might happen.
