## 48 laws of power

**Preface**

- The author argues about the importance of chasing power through secrecy, strategy and deceit rather than honesty and openness. 
- Look at the mistakes you've made in the past through these 48 laws and commit not to repeat them again.
- My thoughts:
  - "No one wants less power; everyone wants more." The book makes broad claims about human nature which are demonstrably false. But I think it's this kind of writing can have the most impact on people-- it seems a great combination of stories are arguments to change people's opinions.
  - Reading the books reminds me of the cobra kai series. "Strike first, strike hard, no mercy" approach more than "use only for self defense approach"

**Law 1: Never outshine the master**

- Make your masters appear and feel smarter than they are. Make them feel superior. Pleasing them by displaying your talents might accomplish the opposite.
- How to actually impress superiors?
  - Discreet flattery. Act naive and make it seem that you need his help. Let him show off what he knows.
  - Credit. Ascribe your ideas to him, make it that your idea is just an echo of his.
  - Tone down. If you're better than your superior at wit, social, generosity, tone is down. By letting other people outshine, you remain in control-- without being a victim of their insecurity.
- Thoughts:
  - Really? How does this play out in a supervisor situation? How does this play out in an interview situation?
  - Could discreet flattery backfire? "this guys is too dumb." Could credit backfire? He takes first author on the paper. 
  - All of us have a self image. Me: ML researcher. Stoic. Disciplined.
  - Discussion with Amar:
    - your success = his success? that might change the dynamics a little. But if you're directly working with you boss's boss, you need to be more careful.
    - Look at the mean! Statements apply to the mean of the distribution, not everyone. There are always outliers.
    - more applicable to young bosses
  - 
- Questions:
  - When have I violated this law in the past?
  - Where can I apply this law in my life?

**Law 2: use enemies, don't trust friends**

- It is sometimes better to keep enemies, than converting to friends, because they will stop us from getting lazy. You cannot grow stronger without an enemy. If you want to motivate a team, use an enemy. 
- Use friends to do your dirty work, and use them as scapegoats if something goes off.
- Problem with friends:
  - You don't know them well. They hide bad qualities and show you only the good side. 
  - Friends are rarely the best fit of partners.
  - They feel more envy and ingratitude.
- Turning enemies to friends:
  - Show them love. Show them that even though they hate you, you help them out when things get hard. 
  - Help your enemies when they are in grave danger, and they will do anything for you.
- Thoughts:
  - What about people like Khabib? I love him because he train with his friends and helps them out. 
  - Amar: using them as business partners
  - you give friends things easily, thye values less

**Law 3: conceal your intentions**

- Especially when you love someone, giving that information up early only make them disinterested in you.
- Why do we do it?
  - We want to be felt understood by other people.
  - It is hard to be strategic about this. People have the illusion that being an open book is the key.
- Why conceal? If you're open and honest, you're too predictable. No one will respect / fear you.
- "Seem to want something you're indifferent to throw the enemy off guard, talk endlessly about your goals and desires"
- Be nice to your enemies as because your trust puts you in a better position to land a devastating blow. If you want to defeat someone, seem innocuous so that they let their guard down. 
- How to conceal?
  - Don't be an actor. Just be bland. 
  - Use patterns to your advantage. Seem like someone who acts in accordance to patterns / mental models of your enemy. Violate suddenly. 
  - Blend in with people. Don't be recognized. Violate suddenly. 
- Thoughts:
  - CAll with Amar
    - "I like you" -- if you get something, things change. you've acheieved it, poeple stop working. do it back and forth
    - "people pick new stuff to solve always"
    - give poeple things slowly
- Questions:
  - Where can I apply this law in my life?
    - Maybe I shouldn't care too strongly about "being understood" or giving others an accurate image of who I am. That is a advantage if you ever get in a competition with them.
    - Negotiations. Sellings.
    - Everyone wants to feel imporatnt. Don't 

**Law 4: say less than necessary**

- why?
  - This will make others ponder more about why we said whatever we said. Which adds to your power.
  - The less you tout your work, the more people talk about it.
  - Reduces the risk of saying something bad and embarrassing yourself. 
  - Sarcasm rarely helps; the momentary satisfaction will be outweighed by the price you pay. 
- Reversal: you can talk more to look like a fool, that you can use for deception.

**Law 5: guard your reputation**

- how?
  - when you don't have a reputation, attack the reputation of the compeititors by sowing doubts about them. 
  - when you have reputation, don't outright straightly attack; do something humorous light-hearted mocking; ridicule with sataire, never go all out.
  - establish a strong reputation, predict attacks on it. never appear desperate in your self-defense. If you reputation is marred, collaborate with people will good reputation.

**Law 6: Gain attention**

- What's unseen counts for nothing. Stand out, don't get lost in the crowd.
