Summary:
This is a wonderful book that covers the science of: desire dopamine, control dopamine and H&N chemicals in the brain. It gives insights into how these chemials lead to different personalities in humans. And suggests a way to find a balance between these chemicals to be happy. The chapter on genius was very insightful!

Rating: 9/10.

Chapter 1: Love
- Dopamine based satisfaction doesn't last. Chasing it is crazy. 
- You can never really reach an end point to dopamine based staisfaction. Whatever you acheive, dopamine makes you want to crave for more. And gives you a harsh negative jolt if you lose anything that you already have (or are used to).
- We need to shift our focus from dopamine to H&Ns: serotonin, oxytocin, endorphines, etc., 
- Shift from passionate love (which lasts 12-18 months) to companiate love (which is long lasting). It leads to enduring staisfaction and a resistance to change. Dopamine and H&Ns generally are in a battle with each other. 
- When love evolves into H&N, testosterone reduces, vasopressin increases and they're more likely to marry and stay together.
- People who genetically have high levels of dopamine have the highest number of sexual partners. It's bad luck that they can never be satisfied. 
- People tend to day dream while having sex because of dopamine. People who experience the sensation in the moment release H&N. 
- With anticipation, dopamine makes us crave the experience more. But once we have the experience, dopamine dips and dopamine driven craving fades away.
- In natural rewards (such as food), only unexpected rewards made them fire (reward prediction error, not the reward itself). In aritifial rewards (such as drugs), any rewards made them fire. 

My thoughts:
- While it's very tempting to chase the dopamine based love (someone who's attractive and fit), it hardly makes a difference once you're 12-18 months in. All that matters if how much you enjoy the other person's company reflected in H&N chemicals. So when choosing a partner, give a strong preference to H&N. 
- Does the same apply for work? A new project is fun in the early stages but it gets boring after a while. Think about how the principles in this chapter can be extended to work.

Chapter 2: Drugs
- Dopamine can dominate reason and make you crave behaviors that are self destructive. 
- Only the first few bites of addictive food taste good, later it's only makes you feel guity and you don't really enough the physical sensations of eating more. 
- Aristotle aruged that the only thing we chase (which explains all our behaviors) is happiness. He's wrong. We rarely rationally take choices, we often do the opposite of what makes us happy.
- Dopamine makes sense evolutionarily. Looking around and craving for high energy foods in the forest. 
- Dopamine produces imagination of a rosy future. Which much better than what it's like in reality. But these same neuron don't fire when the event is actually happening. 
- If we make a wise prurchase, the H&N gratification will compensate for the loss in dopamine. Else, we feel that it's an unwise purchase. 
- The distinction between what we want and what we like is subtle, but there. 
	- "want": the desire to buy something (dopamins)
	- "like": enjoying the thing that you wanted and bought (H&N)
- Addictive substances trigger the desire circuit which can't be matched by natural stimuli. For an addict, the dopamine hit is much more important than paying his rent for schooling his children. The addict can never have enough drugs, he always needs more. 
- For drugs, the model of RPE doesn't apply because they are too powerful compared to natural stimuli. You are just as excited each time you take it. *might not completely true*
- Faster dopamine rush substances are more addicitive. Higher dopamine release substances are more addictive. 
- While the craving doesn't stop, the brain loses it's ability to deliver the high (so much that they might as well replace the drug with salt water). 
- If you don't get the drug, you feel low because the dopamine firing drops below the baseline. 
- Lesson: Don't mess with your dopamine reward circuitry, it's not easy to fix it.
- If something is easy to access, you're much more likely to get addicted (eg. nicotine, porn, etc.). Making people more aware of not smoking or raising the taxes on them is not a good solution, access needs to be made harder. 
- Excessive pornography is similar to addiction. You tolerance increases. You have less urge for more natural stimulus. Sex addicts watch to avoid the lows of dopamine firing. 
- Same with video games. Young people are more vulnerable because they don't have fully developed frontal lobes. And this is the perfect environment for game developers to exploit the dopamine circuitry by giving repeated incremental rewards. Online games specifically use data to exploit the dopamine circuitry in the brain. 
- The pleasure we get while socializing with others is a H&N experience. 
- Neocortex can be used to control dopamine. 

My thoughts:
- Both food and drug addiction are caused by the same chemical in the brain: dopamine. Dopamine can't be an enduring reservoir of joy for natural stimuli like food, over time they become less responsive. This is not true for drug addiction, they never stop firing. 

Chapter 3: Domination
- Desire dopamine goes to the nucleus accumbens and makes us want more. Control dopamine goes to the neocortex which can use higher level thinking to override desire dopamine.
- We need tenacity to succeed in life and dopamine delivers that. When dopamine cells were destroyed in rats, they were not motivated to work to get food anymore.  Dopamine is what makes us put in the effort. 
- Self-efficiacy: you're more likely to succeed if you believe you can. 
- While generally we mirror other's behaviors, it's different with domination. Dominance triggers submission and submission triggers dominance. This happens unconsciously. 
- Success inspired confidence, confidence inspires success. This happens in sports all the time.
- Control dopamine helps us use it for planning, tenacity and force of will. 
- Producing too much dopamine as we drive towards to next goal can lead to an unsatisfied life as in the case of buzz aldrin. He was never satisfied with his accomplishment, his eyes were always set on the next big thing. 
- People with high control dopamine become addicted to success (very high focus). People with low control dopamine have ADHD (low focus).
- Children with ADHD should seek medical drugs early to avoid future issues. They are at bigger risk of obesity and drug addiction.  
- Too much dopamine driven activities without H&N control leads to win at any cost, even if it means cheating / conning attitude develops. 
- Winning competition produces dopamine. It leaves us wanting for more. It raises our expectations; and gives us a low when we don't meet them. 
- H&N makes our empathy circuits trigger. Control dopamine triggers a win at any cost attitude (not just by brute force, but by cleverly navigating obstacles). 
- Resisting temptaion comes at psychic cost. At an interal struggle that can't sustain. 
- How can we get over addiction?
	- Motivational enhancement therapy: desire vs desire dopamine
		- Increase the motivation for alternative activities such as better spouse, a better parent, etc.,
		- Get people to talk about why that kind of life is important (instead of your telling them). In therapy, change topic is patient is getting in a negative thought loop, stick to the subject is the patient talks about how he wants to have a better life. 
	- CBT: control vs desire dopamine
		- take active steps to eliminate triggers. 
	- 12-step facilitation therapy:
		- A&A club; uses H&N activity to avoid drinking.
- Addiction is hard to treat: people are not sure if they want to improve. 

Chapter 4: creativity and madness
- Schizophrenia is caused by excess stimulation. Salience detector, is important to navigate through the world. If it goes off too often, we relate to everything that happening as if it's related to you. 
- Blocking dopamine treats psychosis. The goal is to send just enough dopamine to stop triggering the salience circuit and still not affecting the control dopamine. 
- One is the keys to being creative is letting loose on the first draft. 
- We have models of the world. Models have to breaking for creativity. 
- "right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex" lights up when we imagine, lights up for schizophrenics. that's the area which lights up when we violate models of the world, imaginging things that don't exist. 
- what if we do tDCS and simulate this area? do subjects gets more creative? seems like they do.
- study: dreams are very much like schizophrenia
- right after waking from dreaming sleep, we're highly creative. we can make unconstraints jumps without being constrained by logic. 
- how did Friedrich get the idea of benzene in his dream? because he was working and fell asleep trying the visualize how the properties can be explained, he found connections in his dream but were represented in a bizarre way: snake eating it's tail. 
- Dream inclubation:
	- Choose an important problem that you want to solve.
	- Visualize it in the form of image. Hold it your mind before going to sleep. 
	- Have a pen and paper. And write down the dream as soon as you wake up. 
- High levels of dopamine gives your more creativity and problem solving. But at the cost of H&N activity. So you're more likely to be unsatisfied or nice to other people. 
- Increased dopamine is also related to autism where people don't stay in the here and now. They live in a world with their own ideas without feeling a lot of compassion for other people. 
- Increased dopamine is genetic, it affects your kids (they either become experts or schizophrenics). 
- Newton's genius (creativity) came with bad side effects: he wasted a lot of time on alchemy and bible.
- Creative geniuses always find pleasure in how things can be (but not how they presently are, they don't have the H&N activity to do this). They serve the public well, and even though they make a lot of money, they're not satisfied. 
- Evolutionarily, nature has brought these people into the world so that they can bring new ideas and innovations that benefit the rest of us. 

My thoughts:
- Want makes you satisfied in life could partly be dependant on the amount of dopamine your brain produced genetically. 
- I wonder how much of the creative genius is actually because he comes up with reasonable ideas, and how much is because he comes up with crazy ideas and he gets lucky that it is the right idea. 

Chapter 5: Politics
- Liberals brain produce more dopamine which makes them more: creative, risk-taking, authoritarian, progressive, likely to cheat, etc., (higher IQ). They however might be less satisfied than the conservatives. 
- Loss aversion in the humans is because of the amygdala (the fear increases the dopamine rush when you lose). Evidence by lesion studies. 
- You can't have both: a happy home life (H&N) and a very successful career (dopamine); atleast for most people. Focus your resources appropriately. 

Chapter 6: Progress
- Dopamine makes people become more exploratory. 7R allele of DRD4 gene correlates (responsible to predict people's risk taking ability) with communities which migrated. 
- 7R allele people are quick to adapt, but have stronger dopamine response to wins and losses. 
- People with dopaminergic personalities thrive in unfamiliar environments. H&N personalities help thrive in environments that need strong social connection to survive. 
- Bipolar disorder is also related to dopamine in the brain. Many successful people have it. It's not the excess dopamine allele but a problem with the dopamine transporter.
- Bipolar genes might cause immigration, which explains why there's higher bipolar disorder in the US (4.4%) compared to japan (0.7%). It's also highly inheritable. 
- US is more dopamenergic where as europe is more H&N. 
- Dopamine is helpful when we're facing existential threats and need dopamine to get out of it. Dopamine is unhelpful when we're already reached a level of technological sophistication, it might actually drive us to explore more without considering the worst case scenarios. It might lead us to destruction of the human civilization. 
- People are starting to decide not to have children. Children are expensive. It costs $245k to raise a child to the age of 18, and 160k$ for college tuition. It comes at a cost of vaction homes, travel, restaurants, clothes, etc., 
- VR might make all of us hooked onto the virtual worlds. 

Chapter 7: Harmony
- We need the right balance between H&N and dopamine. Too much H&N might make you not want to get out of bed.
- Dopamine will never help us be satisfied. We need to find a way to get off the treadmill. 
- Flow is an experience that's high in both dopamine and H&N. It can be immensely satisfactory. 
- Multitasking doesn't work. It increases total task time, total errors made and is mentally more draining to switch. 
- Wandering mind is less happy. Mind involved in the present is more happy. Human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. 
- Create things in the present. It excites both dopamine and H&N neurons. Eg. woodworking, knitting, painting, decorating, etc.  Coloring can be a lot of fun, even for adults. 
- We need to do activities that combine physical activities with intellectual satisfaction as they will satisfy us as people as a whole. 
- We won't be satisfied with the promotion or buying a new car. It gets boring after a while. It doesn't need anymore intellectual stimulation.
- Study: construction workers are the happiest. not people working in the technology or business sector. because they build things with hands + comradory. What drive people is talking with other people at the end of the day. 
- We can only be happy by giving up on our dopaminergic urges for more. 

My thoughts:
- Sounds like BJJ is the key to happiness. It has every quality that has been expressed in this chapter.
