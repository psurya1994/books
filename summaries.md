summary of the book:

(the problem)
The problem is not that life is short, but it the pressure we put on ourselves on how we want to use this limited time. We want to get more done. 
	- We want to make notable advances on our career and money. However, there is no stopping point, we always strive for more. Even people on top of the food chain, who made it to top schools and have top 1% jobs, continue have the pressure to work with crushing intensity to maintain a lifestyle (which now becomes prerequisite for how they want to live)
	- We additionally also want to fulfill a lot of our personal goals: travel, family, parenting, meditate, workout and eat healthy. Again, this is a never ending cycle too; especially in this age of technology which exposes us to better possibility. Good is not good enough anymore, we want something better. 
	There's too many things we want to do and too little time. This can be a source of anxiety in one's life.

(traditional solutions)
Traditionally, the self-help books have suggested strategies, tricks and tools that can help you get more done. While they help and we get more done, we continue moving the flag post and take on more things; which continues to keep us stuck in struggle to do more. 

(the reality)
There are infinite experiences we can possibly have, but life is limited and we're constraining our experiences with each decision we make. No matter what you do, you're giving up a huge range of possible experience you could have. This needs to be a source of relief. No matter what we do, we can't win this game. 

(a way out: acceptance)
Psychologically, embrace that you can't do everything, and accept life as is. Still continue to do things, but don't look at time as a depleting resource. Instead understand that there is no cosmic rule that entitles you to deserve any of this, and you have much more than you have any right to expect. Just try to make the most out of each moment. 

(a way out: practical tips)
You can do it by: (i) do the most important things you resist today (eg. draw two hours everyday and accept the consequences for it), (ii) have a list of 3 important things and only work on them (you can always update the list).

(a way out: settle)
Commit to your previous actions and settle with specific things that are imporatnt to you instead of striving for more.

(the difficulty)
Each time the going gets boring on an important task, we have an urge to check twitter to feel better. We're not used to accepting the reality of boredom as it is, we want to change it. But only if we accept it, and keep our full attention on it, that we realize that it's not really that uncomfortable.

All we have is now. The past is a memory. The future is imagined. The present moment is all we have. But we keep worrying about part of future. You will always have this uncertainity about the future, it will never go away no matter how much you plan. [airport exmaple]. 

Don't treat time as an entity we own, treat is as a thing that was given to us, something we had no right to expect. 

Deleted:

In addition, there is a pressure to fulfill non-career related desires such as travel, spending time in nature, spending time with family, etc. This is worsed by technology by showing us more better options. Good is never good enough, we want something better.
