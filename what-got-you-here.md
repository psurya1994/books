The trouble with success: us previous success prevents us from achieving more success.

Chapter 1: 
- examples of successful people guilty of making specific mistakes

Chapter 2:
- talks about the author's consulting experience

Chapter 3:
- we delude ourselves in the workplace
	- we overestimate our contribution to the project
	- we take partial or complete credit for success that belongs to others
	- have an elevated option of our skills and standing among peers
	- exaggerate the impact of our projects, without accounting for the costs.
- these delusions are a results of previous successes. these delusions are helpful, as they give us confidence to work on bigger things. 
- but when someone wants to change our ways, we resist. because we believe this is the right way that leads to success, as it worked for us. 
- 4 beliefs that made us successful, but stop us from getting to the next level
- #1: I have succeeded. 
	- I have the skills and talent.
	- We ignore the failures and remember only the successes when thinking back. 
	- Successful people recount their successes, and forget the failures.
	- when team succeds, successful people think it was "their" contribution more than facts suggest.
- #2: I can succeed.
	- they feel that they have the skills to become successful, that they can change the course of the company if put in the right position.
	- they think they've come here because of the skills, when the reality is that they're here because of a lot of luck
	- I'm successful, I behave this way. Successful people draw a causal link between these two.
- #3: I will succeed
	- I have the motivation to be successful.
	- This will lead to overcommitment in projects, and hence the downfall.
	- These people are overcommitted to things, and don't have the time to reevaluate / take a step back to change.
- #4: I choose to succeed
	- By assuming that they're choosing, they're over committed.
	- Successful people never want to feel like being controlled or manipulated. 
	- It's hard to get these people to "choose to change"
- successful people have these 4 beliefs: I have the skills, the confidence, the motivation and the free choise to succeed.
- Neuroscience: when you receive a reward each time to take a actions, we assume a casual link: action -> reward. 
- successful got these because of some of their behaviors, and inspite of some of their other behaviors. seeing this clearly is the first step.
- people can't think of anyone else who's more creative than them -> delusion of successs.
- sales people think they're more successful because of their hard negotiation style, but it might be just beacuse of they make more sales calls.
- you need to think closely and understand what behaviors and leading to your success, and what behaviors inspite of. [P]
- Natural law: "In order for me to get you to do what I want to do, I have to prove that doing so will benefit you in some way, immediately or later." or -- to make you do something, I need to prove that it will benefit you in someway. Everyone thinks, "what's in it for me"?
- Successful people only work together / build a synergy -- only when it benefits the both of them.
- what do people chase success? money, power, status, popularity. and when all of these requirements are fulfuilled / satisfied, they might have additional goals like beating a rival, leaving a legacy, being a good example to their kids, etc. [P]

Chapter 4: 
- Knowing what to stop
	- We always focus on what more we need to do, but not what we need to do less of 
	- Avoiding bad commitments is just as valuable as getting good sales. 
	- It doesn't get as much attention / popularity from others.
- Shifting into neutral
	- To get rid of bad behaviors, don't try to replace it with good. Aim for something smaller, just stopping the bad behavior (eg. being rude). 
	- When someone suggests a bad idea, challenges your decision, say nothing; just consider things. 
	- When someone makes a helpful suggestion, say thanks -- don't remind them that you already knew it. 
- What's wrong with us?
	- Here are the most common flaws (not of skills, but wrt interpersonal issues)

- Reframing more cleanly:
	- #1: Good listening, calm nature, constructive feedback
		- #2: giving our opinion on everything
		- #4: giving destructive feedback
		- #5: starting with but
		- #7: speaking when angry
		- #16: not listening
		- #6: showing off that you're smart
		- #8: negativity about other's ideas
	- #2: Honest Acknowledgement: Taking responsiblity for mistakes, giving credit
		- #10: not giving proper recognition
		- #11: claiming credit we don't deserve
		- #12: making excuses
		- #14: failing to see when we treat others unfairly
		- #15: refusing to express regret
		- #17: failing to express gratitude
		- #19: blaming everyone but ourselves
		- #20: exalting our flaws because htat's who we are.
	- #3: Being fair to others
		- #1: winning at all costs
		- #9: not sharing information, to keep advantage over others
		- #13: clinging to the past
		- #18: punishing the messenger
		- #3: rating others based on our standards
- Following these rules can help turn others into our ally, which is beneficial in the long term.
- Fixing these is easy, but not simple. 
- The higher you go up the ladder, the more important are the behavioral problems. If you have good people skills, you can go to higher places than your more technical counter parts. 
	- eg. it's more important for the doctor on how he apologizes for wait times, how he listens and how he delivers bad news more than the medication itself.
- As we progress in our careers, behavioral changes are the only major changes we can make.
- #1: winning at all costs
	- don't rub it into people's faces when you win, just brush it off and enjoy the evening
	- don't let the relationship compromise because of your desire to win
	- the winning gene you have got you here, but rely on it more and more will cause problems
- #2: giving our opinion on everything, the need to add value
	- the feeling that you already know the argument, why it doesn't work, and why there's a better way to do things. 
	- when you say "it's a good idea, but it will work better if you do it this way"; you may have improved the content of the idea by 5% but reduced commitment to executing it by 50%
	- solution: take a breath before you try to add value, consider if it's really worth it
	- solution: if your boss tries to add too much value, stick to your position, be confident about your expertise
- #3: rating others based on our standards, passing judgement
	- when people are trying to honestly help us, and offer ideas, don't respond with judgement of their ideas. listen and consider closely. 
	- Say "thanks, you've given me something to think about" often. It makes people want to share ideas and collaborate with you.
- #4: giving destructive feedback
	- be careful because you can't take your words back 
	- we need to filter truth telling, give the truth only when it's useful / helpful
- #5: starting with but 
	- using that word means: what you're saying is wrong and what I'm saying is right. nothing productive can happen after that. 
	- don't use but.
- #6: showing off that you're smart
	- we do this because we want to win the admiration of other people. but the strategy often backfires. 
	- never say "I already knew that", it's always better to listen and say thanks -- it makes other feel bad, and they won't get back to you with information next time
	- talk to subordinates in the same way you'd talk to your boss
- #7: speaking when angry
	- it destroys your reputation, good work can't compensate for this
	- be stoic
	- solution: just keep your mouth close
- #8: negativity about other's ideas
	- 
- #9: not sharing information, to keep advantage over others
- #10: not giving proper recognition
- #11: claiming credit we don't deserve
- #12: making excuses
- #13: clinging to the past
- #14: failing to see when we treat others unfairly
- #15: refusing to express regret
- #16: not listening
- #17: failing to express gratitude
- #18: punishing the messenger
- #19: blaming everyone but ourselves
- #20: exalting our flaws because htat's who we are.
- to change to behavior, pay 10$ each time you violate.
