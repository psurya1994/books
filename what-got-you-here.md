The trouble with success: us previous success prevents us from achieving more success.

Chapter 1: 
- examples of successful people guilty of making specific mistakes

Chapter 2:
- talks about the author's consulting experience

Chapter 3:
- we delude ourselves in the workplace
	- we overestimate our contribution to the project
	- we take partial or complete credit for success that belongs to others
	- have an elevated option of our skills and standing among peers
	- exaggerate the impact of our projects, without accounting for the costs.
- these delusions are a results of previous successes. these delusions are helpful, as they give us confidence to work on bigger things. 
- but when someone wants to change our ways, we resist. because we believe this is the right way that leads to success, as it worked for us. 
- 4 beliefs that made us successful, but stop us from getting to the next level
- #1: I have succeeded. 
	- I have the skills and talent.
	- We ignore the failures and remember only the successes when thinking back. 
	- Successful people recount their successes, and forget the failures.
	- when team succeds, successful people think it was "their" contribution more than facts suggest.
- #2: I can succeed.
	- they feel that they have the skills to become successful, that they can change the course of the company if put in the right position.
	- they think they've come here because of the skills, when the reality is that they're here because of a lot of luck
	- I'm successful, I behave this way. Successful people draw a causal link between these two.
- #3: I will succeed
	- I have the motivation to be successful.
	- This will lead to overcommitment in projects, and hence the downfall.
	- These people are overcommitted to things, and don't have the time to reevaluate / take a step back to change.
- #4: I choose to succeed
	- By assuming that they're choosing, they're over committed.
	- Successful people never want to feel like being controlled or manipulated. 
	- It's hard to get these people to "choose to change"
- successful people have these 4 beliefs: I have the skills, the confidence, the motivation and the free choise to succeed.
- Neuroscience: when you receive a reward each time to take a actions, we assume a casual link: action -> reward. 
- successful got these because of some of their behaviors, and inspite of some of their other behaviors. seeing this clearly is the first step.
- people can't think of anyone else who's more creative than them -> delusion of successs.
- sales people think they're more successful because of their hard negotiation style, but it might be just beacuse of they make more sales calls.
- you need to think closely and understand what behaviors and leading to your success, and what behaviors inspite of. [P]
- Natural law: "In order for me to get you to do what I want to do, I have to prove that doing so will benefit you in some way, immediately or later." or -- to make you do something, I need to prove that it will benefit you in someway. Everyone thinks, "what's in it for me"?
- Successful people only work together / build a synergy -- only when it benefits the both of them.
- what do people chase success? money, power, status, popularity. and when all of these requirements are fulfuilled / satisfied, they might have additional goals like beating a rival, leaving a legacy, being a good example to their kids, etc. [P]

20 habits holding you back: identify your most annoying interpoersonal issues

Chapter 4: 
- Knowing what to stop
	- We always focus on what more we need to do, but not what we need to do less of 
	- Avoiding bad commitments is just as valuable as getting good sales. 
	- It doesn't get as much attention / popularity from others.
- Shifting into neutral
	- To get rid of bad behaviors, don't try to replace it with good. Aim for something smaller, just stopping the bad behavior (eg. being rude). 
	- When someone suggests a bad idea, challenges your decision, say nothing; just consider things. 
	- When someone makes a helpful suggestion, say thanks -- don't remind them that you already knew it. 
- What's wrong with us?
	- Here are the most common flaws (not of skills, but wrt interpersonal issues)
	- #1: winning at all costs
	- #2: giving our opinion on everything

- Reframing more cleanly:
	- #1: Good listening, calm nature, constructive feedback
		- #2: giving our opinion on everything
		- #4: giving destructive feedback
		- #5: starting with but
		- #7: speaking when angry
		- #16: not listening
		- #6: showing off that you're smart
		- #8: negativity about other's ideas
	- #2: Honest Acknowledgement: Taking responsiblity for mistakes, giving credit
		- #10: not giving proper recognition
		- #11: claiming credit we don't deserve
		- #12: making excuses
		- #14: failing to see when we treat others unfairly
		- #15: refusing to express regret
		- #17: failing to express gratitude
		- #19: blaming everyone but ourselves
		- #20: exalting our flaws because htat's who we are.
	- #3: Being fair to others
		- #1: winning at all costs
		- #9: not sharing information, to keep advantage over others
		- #13: clinging to the past
		- #18: punishing the messenger
		- #3: rating others based on our standards
- Following these rules can help turn others into our ally, which is beneficial in the long term.
- Fixing these is easy, but not simple. 
- The higher you go up the ladder, the more important are the behavioral problems. If you have good people skills, you can go to higher places than your more technical counter parts. 
	- eg. it's more important for the doctor on how he apologizes for wait times, how he listens and how he delivers bad news more than the medication itself.
- As we progress in our careers, behavioral changes are the only major changes we can make.
- #1: winning at all costs
	- don't rub it into people's faces when you win, just brush it off and enjoy the evening
	- don't let the relationship compromise because of your desire to win
	- the winning gene you have got you here, but rely on it more and more will cause problems
- #2: giving our opinion on everything, the need to add value
	- the feeling that you already know the argument, why it doesn't work, and why there's a better way to do things. 
	- when you say "it's a good idea, but it will work better if you do it this way"; you may have improved the content of the idea by 5% but reduced commitment to executing it by 50%
	- solution: take a breath before you try to add value, consider if it's really worth it
	- solution: if your boss tries to add too much value, stick to your position, be confident about your expertise
- #3: rating others based on our standards, passing judgement
	- when people are trying to honestly help us, and offer ideas, don't respond with judgement of their ideas. listen and consider closely. 
	- Say "thanks, you've given me something to think about" often. It makes people want to share ideas and collaborate with you.
- #4: giving destructive feedback
	- be careful because you can't take your words back 
	- we need to filter truth telling, give the truth only when it's useful / helpful
- #5: starting with but 
	- using that word means: what you're saying is wrong and what I'm saying is right. nothing productive can happen after that. 
	- don't use but.
- #6: showing off that you're smart
	- we do this because we want to win the admiration of other people. but the strategy often backfires. 
	- never say "I already knew that", it's always better to listen and say thanks -- it makes other feel bad, and they won't get back to you with information next time
	- talk to subordinates in the same way you'd talk to your boss
- #7: speaking when angry
	- it destroys your reputation, good work can't compensate for this
	- be stoic
	- solution: just keep your mouth close
- #8: negativity about other's ideas
	- 
- #9: not sharing information, to keep advantage over others
	- Problem: it rarely achieves the desired effect, you're losing trust. 
	- to have power, you need loyalty rather than fear or suspision
	- sometimes you do this because you're unaware. make sure you're doing it more than necessary.
	- the coworkers need to  feel like you care about what they have to say
- #10: not giving proper recognition
	- recognition is very important for other people. give it to them whenever necessary.
	- this takes so little time, and can be massively impactful to add to your power
- #11: claiming credit we don't deserve
	- be careful to not claim credit for things that you've not done. 
	- you do this because of the need to win
	- compensate for your self centered bias.
- #12: making excuses
	- Just say you're sorry. DOn't make excuses, either "it's my assistants mistake" or "I keep forgetting things" -- they don't work
- #13: clinging to the past
	- people cling to the past (I've grown up this way) to justify their behaviors. 
- #14: failing to see when we treat others unfairly / playing favorites
	- don't pay extra attention to people who try to flatter you. don't give them extra credit.
- #15: refusing to express regret
	- refusing to apologize increases the bitterness. say you're sorry, so that you turn other people into allies. 
	- to gain a friend, let him do you a favor. 
	- ask someone for help, to build a relationship.
- #16: not listening
	- when someone presenting, try to understand it; instead of asking thme to skip over
	- it turns away top talent from workign for you
- #17: failing to express gratitude
	- Always say thanks when someone tries to help.
	- This is what makes people continue to want to talk to you
	- you don't need to wait to say thank you, just leave a message to them
	- you can't over do it. keep thanking people everytime.
- #18: punishing the messenger
	- if someone wants to give a helpful warning, say thanks for the info and that you'll consider it carefully. 
	- don't shoot them down
- #19: blaming everyone but ourselves / passing the buck
	- it's ok not to be perfect. accepting it make other people respect you.
- #20: exalting our flaws because htat's who we are.
	- 
- to change to behavior, pay 10$ each time you violate.

Chapter 5: goal obsession (the 21st habit)
- being full goal obsessed comes at a huge cost:
	- you compromise you health and relationships to get to the goal
	- we might use questionable measure ot get to the goal
	- makes us miss the bigger picture, makes us violate our values
	- makes our life more stressful: because it causes unnecessary conflicts in life

How can we get better?

Chapter 6: feedback
- confidential feedback from everyone is the best way to identify how to improve relationships at work.
- never argue someone who is giving feedback. 
- simply say thank you when you hear feedback; if you think it's flawed, you don't need to act on it.
- three types of feedback: solicited, unsolicited, observation

Chapter 7: apologizing
- apologize heartfully. 

Chapter 8: telling the world
- tell the people you want to change, only then will they notice is.
- tell multiples times

Chapter 9: listening
- listening is an active process, listen intensely. think before you speak. 
- everything you say will have so much more value when you do that.
- listen with respect. act as if the other people is the only thing is the universe and listen intensely. 
- make the other person like they're the most important person in the world. this is what seperates the great from the elite. 
- brag about the other person to them
- meditation helps you become an incredible listener, the ability to focus on soemthing wihtout judgement.
- the more you let the other people speak, and help them feel good, the more they respect you.

Chapter 10: thanking
- feel grateful for all the help other people do to you, and say thanks.
- be extreme in gratitude.

Chapter 11: following up
- for people who gave you specific suggestions on improving, reach out to them as ask if you've been putting them to practice. 
- this is how you measure progres, this is how you make other people realize that you're changing, shows that you value the other person, shows that you care about improving

Chapter 12: practicing feedforward
- Feedforward:
	- #1: Pick one behavior that you would like to change. 
	- #2: Find someone.
	- #3: Ask for two suggestions to improve.
	- #4: say thank you.
	- do this for multiple people.
- What you need to improve on, needs to be informed by feedback from others.
- It's easier to take, than feedback.

How to apply these changes to your life, and what to stop doing now

Chapter 13: Changing 
- Obey the following rules to be better at behavior change:
	- #1: see clearly if it's a skill problem or a behavioral problem
	- #2: pick the right things to change, don't overcommit
	- #3: don't delude yourself about what really needs to change
	- #4: don't hide from the truth you need to hear (ask for feedback)
	- #5: there is no ideal behavior (don't aim for perfect)
		- you don't need to be perfect at every aspect. only fix the ones that are hindering your growth.
	- #6: measure it, if you want to improve it
	- #7: pay someone when you violate things
	- #8: the best time to change is now

Chapter 14: Special challenges for people in charge
- tell people what your weak points ahead of time, so that they are aware. tell them you don't mean any of that actually. 
- if your staff needs too much of your time, tell them to figure out where you can cut down. 
- if someone doesn't follow your commands, follow up. Following up shows that what you're asking is actually high priority.
- employees mindset: 20s they want to learn, 30s they want to grow, 40s they want to rule
- managers should stop thinking they know more than their employees. it's a blindspot that dmiminishes their stature. 
- company needs a specific knowledge worker, more than he needs the company.
- stop trying to change employees who don't want to change. 
- why star employees stay? work is exciting and meaningful, have friends here, opportunity to follow dreams
