# Sapiens notes


Consolidation:
## Part 1: Cognitive revolution

### Chapter 1: An Animal of No Significance

- Intro
	- Cognitive revolution: 70k years ago, agricultural revolution: 12k years ago, scientific revolution: 500 years ago.
	- Human like animals: 2.5million years ago, not special at all. Same like gorillas. 
	- Species: animals are said to belong to the same species if they can mate. (Q: then it seems hard to draw a hard line to count number of species -- especially given that the animals are on a continous spectrum with very small DNA changes)
	- Homosapiens: the species "sapiens" (wise) of genus Homo (man)

- Skeletons in Closet
	- We lived with multiple species who were our cousins at one point. We're the only species who survived. Homospaiens mostly drove to extinction (relpcaement theory) and a little bit of inter breeding (interbreeding theory)
	- Our ancestors lived for 2 million years without causing any chaos. Fire was one of the initial discoveries that led to notable changes.
	- What led to this extraordinary success of homosapeints? Likely language. 

### Chapter 2: Tree of Knowledge

- Cognitive revolution was when the homosapiens over ran other species. (Q: what kind of changes to brain / DNA led to this possibility? This knowledge would be very valuable specially as we're trying to build machines that are just as smart)
- Was it the language? Homosapiens were about to string together words and make long sentences (not only different vocal sounds). It further led to developing fictions and organizing big societies.
- Chimp culture: 25-50 people, gossip: upto 150 people, fictions: unlimited people (can co-operate)

### Chapter 3: Day in the life of Adam and Eve
