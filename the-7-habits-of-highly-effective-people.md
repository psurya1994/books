the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.md

Inside-out:
- many people who has tremendous outward success struggle with personal relationships, health, effectively managing people, bad children, happiness, meaning.
- quick fixes can't solve these problems
- our lens through which we see the world, massively shapes who we perceive the world
- two fields of thoughts on what leads to success:
	- #1: character ethic: integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty
	- #2: personality ethic: skills, attitudes, behaviors, technique, power strategies, etc.
- most literature sees #2 as necessary and #1 and a good to have on the side. 
- if you want to help you kid lagging behind, you should first stop seeing him as inadequate. you need to change yourself first, before trying to change him. 
	- don't worry more about how others will judge you (because of your kid), rather than genuinely trying to help him. 
	- be driven by #1 instead of #2. instead of focusing on what techniques would work best, focus on how you can change your mental attitude. 
	- enjoy and value him, and you see his personality naturally emerge. 
	- see him as fundamentally capable, and stop trying to protect him with everything. convey the message "you're ok, you don't need your parents protection"
	- how the child feels internally about himself, affects how well he does. the child develops these internal feeling based on how you treat him.
- In true, #1 is primary and #2 is secondary. Develop your personal ethic to build lasting relationships.
- we need an accurate map to be able to navigate the world well. we generally see the world as we've been conditioned, not how it actually is. 
- we generally think we are right, and will be demanding on others. unless some new information comes up that's a paradigm shift. we need to get into a state that we're fully understanding the situation of the other person before demanding from them.
- the principles covered here are fundamental, and part of human nature. 
- principles are different from practices. a suggested practice works in a specific context. principles work everytime, everywhere. 
- principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring value. 
- you will only be able to make slow progress at these principles, there is no quick fix.
- eg. of violation of the principle: telling your friends taht you can play the piano at concert level when you're just a beginner. 
- when you're using #2 techniques without consideration for #1, you're setting yourself up for failure. 
- if your kid is not sharing toys with others, it might be because she needs to expereince possessing things before sharing. try to understand that need, instead of forcing something.
	- if you use strength to get something done, it builds weakness in relationship. if you're not equals, both people become more arbitrary and defensive. 
	- principle: when children get a sense of real possession, they share naturally, freely and spontaneously. it doesn't have to be forced. 
	- there are times to teach, and times to non teach. never teach when the emotions are high.
- these principles are an inside-out approach, which is first trying to change yourself before you try to have influence on otehrs. 
- using outside-in, pushing other people based on their weaknesses, leads to long term suffering. if you think the problem is out there, and if that external thing is solved, it will all be fine, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. 

The 7 habits - overview:
- Our character is a composite of our habits. Habits are unconscious patterns we follow daily to express our character. They influence our effectiveness. 
- Habit: intersection of knowledge (what to do, why to do), skill (how to do) and desire (want to do). 
- progress of a human: dependence -> independence -> interdependence. this happens across all qualities: physical, intellectual, mental, emotionally, etc.
- people think independence is the best thing to have, but that's often because they're vulnerable to worry based on other's behaviors. 
- interdependence is a far more mature state, it is the recognition that we need to come together to build something bigger. you are not vulnerable to the worries of other people anymore. 
- have you to be independent, before you can become interdependent. 
- to produce effectively, you need to have P/PC balance. P: production, PC: production capability. #2 focuses on getting P done at the cost of PC.
	- Maintaining PC is not hard, but once it's lost, getting it back takes a lot of resources. 
- In relationships, keep your focus on PC, keeping your relationship healthy. Do things that you might not want to do otherwise.
- PC principle: treat your employees as you want them to treat your best customers. don't focus on exploiting your employees for all they can give, focus on a more sustainable relationship. focus on getting people to commit to doing things without external supervision. 

Habit 1: Be proactive
- Summary: Take responsibilty over the situation and focus on what you control. Accept what you can't control, and learn to be happy with that. 
- We tend to project our view of the world on others, and call it objective.
- When people say "why can't you solve this easy problem", they are often more projections (than who you truly are)
- We have free will, to exercise the freedom to choose, between stimulus and response.
- Being proactive: taking responsiblity for you own life, without blaming others
- Reactive people are quite vulnerable to what happens around them. When someone says something, their emotional state changes. 
- When you transcend suffering and live by your core values, people are inspired. 
- People who proactively seek more opportunities to solve a problem are the ones who succeed in life. 
- Don't take victim mentality. Take responsibility for your situation, don't put the blame on external circumstances. 
- Circle on concern vs circle of influence. There are many things that concern us, but we can influence only a few of those things. Focus on what you can influence. This increases our circle of influence.
- three areas in life:
	- direct control: can be fixed with private victories following habits 1,2,3.
	- indirect control: problems involving other's behaviors: can be fixed by focusin on 4,5,6.
	- no control: learn to access and be happy about the way they are
- when you make mistakes, acknowledge them and learn from them. don't dwell on them.
- Angela Duckworth: just two things determine your success: grit and how you get along with other people.

Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind
- Summary:  
	- Examine your values closely, and decide on what the end goal is. Take only actions that move you towards your end. Everything else is unnecessary.
	- Center your core (security, guidance, wisdom, power) based on principles; not on any external factors. 
	- Write a personal mission statement where you list the principles: this is something that takes a few weeks / months to put together. Once you have it, the decision you need to make in any situation falls naturally.
	- Write something similar for your family and organization, and you'll see everything becoming much easier. 
- How do I want to be known during my funeral as a:
	- Spouse: Caring. Listening. Loving. Helping me grow. Putting me before himself. Going out of his way to do nice things for me.
	- Friend: Always happy, smiling and helpful. Eloquent.
	- Work: put the organization goals first, and made massive contributions to the team.
- Examine your behavior today, based on your end goals. Make sure all actions you take, do not violate the end goals of your life. 
- It is possible to be very busy without being effective. 
- You build things twice: first you your mind, later out there in the world.
- If you want to build a successful business, have a clear plan first. And be clear on the goals. If not, you won't be able to succeed.
- Leadership is about doing the right things, management is baout doing things right. Leadership determines the direction, management determines who to make progress in that direction. 
- There are many good managers, but it's rare to have good leaders.
- Clarity your values, before focusing on your goals. 
- Be aware, and rescript your behaviors / actions based on your values. Remove unnecessary behaviors and add necessary ones. (eg. using authority to change children's behavior, and having a shattered relationship with this -- this is the kidn of behavior that needs changing)
- Create a personal mission statement. Focus on the character you want to build, and what you want to accomplish based on these values. 
	- When you have a clear guide like this, all your effort will be focused in a singular direction and you will make massive progress over the course of your lifetime.
- 4 factors that need to be in harmony:
	- security: sense of self worth
	- guidance: source of direction in life
	- wisdom: sense of balance, and how principles work in the world
	- power: the capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something.
- don't be centered on externals (Eg. spouse, family, money, work, possession, pleasure, friends, etc.). 
	- While they can be a great source of meaning, the issue is that we're going to be vulnerable to anything changing in those externals -- and things always change.
	- self centeredness (selfishness) is also not good. you're emotionally swayed too much about how specific things are happening in your life. 
- it is better to have one single center that drives everything you do in life
	- you need to center yourself on principles (universal, timeless), it create a solid foundation to support the 4 life factors. 
	- the principles remain a constant, no matter what.
	- trust in the principles, the laws that are fundamentally true and have a been validated through centuries and your own experience, and take appropriate actions.
	- when a decision is 0-sum, consider the consequences of each decision, and weight them based on principles. Consider the one that best fits the current situation.
- what to do when you have a difficult decision to make: spouse vs work? using principles is the best way to make this decision because
	- #1: you look at the wholistic situation and consequences of the action we take. without the emotion of the situation
	- #2: you know your decision is effective because it is based on long-term predictable results. 
	- #3: you choose based on what you ultimately value in life
	- #4: you can communicate with both parties effectively, so that they understand
- we have an expanded view of the world when someone close die, we think "whats the point of all of this". simulate this, to be able to think clearly about your principles. 
- if you're violating principles, you can fix it using affirmations and visualization:
	- "It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave."
	- Imagine the situation happening multiple times, and you responding the right way to it. In as much detail as possible.
	- Top performers do this all the time to be effective. 
- each time you feel yourself attached to anything other than the principles, remember that you're setting yourself up for failure. (eg. money, spouse, promotion, selfishness, etc.)
- identify your roles and goals in life: an individual, a husband, a father, a business man, etc. have goals for each of these roles. set long term goals based on your roles in life.
- have a mission statement for your family / organization by taking input from people involved. this helps makes decision easier (especially when there's a 0-sum contest between individual and the team)
- family mission statement
	- write the mission
	- write the principles that we lead you to that mission
	- write the goals you need to accomplish to get there
- decide what you stand for, and stand for it all the time.

Habit 3: put first things first
- given that you know your direction (roles / goals), this chapter is about being able to manage them well. so that you accomplish them efficiently.
- effective management is putting first things first. leadership decides what first things are, management is the discipline to carry it out.
- the successful person differentiates himself by doing the necessary things that failures don't like to do. they're able to do this because they're driven by a strong purpose from habit 2.
- you need to have the will, to do something when you don't want to do it, because purpose comes first. you need to act with integrity.
- time management: organize and execute around priorities
- create the eisenhover matrix to make decisions on what the right action to take now is.
- spend time on things in quadrants 1, 2. Q2 has a long term impact on your life. Q1 has a short term impact on your life. 
- focus on relationships and results, rather than time and methods
- Try to spend more time in Q2 than Q1, as they are the high leverage activities that give you long term results. and keep you p / pc balanace. as you spend more time in q2, q1 will shrink
- Say similing and nonapologetically say no to other things. 
- a lot of people don't work on high leverage activities because they haven't worked out which ones are the most important to focus on
- if you can think clearly about your priroties, because on your core values, that's much of the problem solved.
- focus on quadrant 2 management: manage our lives based on sound principles to maintain the p/pc balance. focus on increasing both p and pc. 
- have weekly goals based on Q2 activities. 
	- identify roles, decide Q2 activities based on those roles
	- select goals for various roles to accomplish in a week 
	- schedule / delegate activities based on those goals
	- adapt daily based on unanticipated factors that came up
- you can increase your output by (a) becoming more efficient, (b) delegating. delegating is one of the highest leverage activities. key to effective management is delegation.
- ways to delegate:
	- gofer delegation: managing someone every step of the way, telling them how to do it
	- stewarship delegation: focused on results instead of methods
- stewardship delegation needs the following:
	- clear mutual understanding of the results
	- guidelines (parameters / constraints) under which the person should operate. you could point out risks of certain methods
	- resources:  provide them with the required resources for the task
	- accountability: set up standard of performance that will be used in evaluating the results, and specific times when the evaluation will take place.
	- consequences: specify what will happen as the result of the evaluation
- once you give the responsibility to someone, make them the boss and you the helper. be ready to provide them with whatever they need

Paradigms of interdependence:
- Effective interdependence can only be build on foundation of true independece.
- You can't just talk yourself out of problems you behave yourself into. It will take a time to rework things.
- The emotional bank account
	- when you make deposits, minor mistakes won't cause any suspicion. but when you're short of deposits, any mistake can blow up (leads to a stressful environment). try to keep it full as much as possible.
	- when it's full, people trust you with what you're saying, you have more influence and power to sway them.
- Ways to make the deposits:
	- #1: understanding the individual / deep listening
		- helps you understand what actually consistutes a deposit
		- makes what important to them as important to you, work with them to help them achieve their goals
		- don't enfore your views of what's a deposit onto them, understand their needs and act accordingly. 
	- #2: attending to little things
		- people are tender inside, and have small needs that they want to experience. fulfill those needs, don't discount them, they're more important than they seem
	- #3: keeping commitments
		- if you violate a promising, next time you make it they don't believe it.
		- if you can't fulfil it anymore, ask their permission
	- #4: clarifying expectations
		- be clear on who's going to do what. 
		- the man and his spouse have unstated expectations of what the other person needs to do. fulfilling them makes deposits to the relationship, violating them makes withdrawals. make the expectations clear, discuss, debate and finalize. this saves a lot of time down the road. 
	- #5: showing personal integrity
		- be loyal to the people who're not present, this helps you build trust with the people who are present
		- defend those who're absent. be the same in front of and behind anyone. 
	- #6: apologizing sincerely when you make a withdrawal
		- I was wrong, and that's a mistake. I apologize and I will do better next time. 
		- openly admit mistakes, don't cover up.
- when we love someone without conditions, they feel more secure and do better in life. 
- every P problem is a PC opportunity, it a chance to make emotional deposits 
- when someone comes to you with a problem, see it as an opportunity to build a better relationship with them.

Habit 4: think win win
- to get people to cooperate in your org, you need to build trust. if win for one person in the org is failure for another, there will be a lack of trust. 
- create solutions where there's win / win. it much benefit everyone involved, this will create cooperation. 
- don't try to win in negotiations, find the way that works for the both of you
- if you don't care about the relationship with the other person, you can go for win / lose. but to build long trusting relationships, you need to go win / win
- decide to do contracts which are either win / win or no deal. talk about this honestly. if you're uncomfortable with a deal, you can always say no deal. 
	- "let's try to get a win / win. but if that doesn't work, let's be ok with a no deal. then maybe at a other time we can get together."
- in a relationship, when you can't find win-win. it's better to go no deal than win-lose. (eg. deciding what activity to do)
	- don't compromise for your family and do lose-win too many times, you'll be filled with resentment. 
- 5 dimensions to get a win-win deal
	- character: integrity, maturity, abundance mentality.
		- integrity: being open and honest
		- maturity: balance between courage and consideration. be brave about your needs, and highly considerate about others needs. 
		- abundance: there's enough out there for everyone.
	- relationships: 
		- maintain relationships by adhereing to win-win
		- there's enough trust between parties to openly discuss needs
		- removes negative energy, and create positive energy to thrive together.
	- agreements: create accountability through an explicit agreement
		- win/win management training: when teams of people cooperate well together, they accomplish many more things. 
		- win/win performance agreements
	- systems:
		- win/win only works if the system supports it
		- if the org incentivizes only the top employee, then it's hard to stay on track. whereas if they incentivize most teams who achieve the milestones they set, it's motivating because people start helping each other (there's no 0sum game).
		- don't put systems that incentivizes only P; you need to incentive PC too.
	- processes:
		- see the problem of the other person's view, identify key concerns, determine what would constitute an acceptable solution, identify new options to achieve those results.

Habit 5: seek first to understand, then to be understood
- Anytime you want to diagonose something about another person, first make sure you understand them. Don't suggest any solutions unless you've made sure you understood the problem clearly.
- empathic listening: listening and understanding the other person, without any judgement. focus on really understanding the other person. try to feel what they are feeling.
- being able to understand is a deep psychological need, unless that is satisfied, it's hard to go forward. this increases both P and PC. 
- diagnose before your prescribe: it works everywhere, but best in interpersonal relations.
- 4 ways we naturally respond:
	- evaluate: agree or disagree
	- probe: ask questions from our own frame of reference
	- advise: counsel based on our experience
	- interpret / judge
- 4 ways to emphatic listening:
	- mimic content 
	- rephrase what they're saying
	- reflect how he's feeling
	- rephrase content and reflect the feeling
	- this helps them open us
- you won't be able to convince another person, if they don't see you to be coming from a point of understanding.
- always give them psychological heir with you.
- seeking to understand: consideration, seeking to be understood: courage. you need to have the courage to clearly place your own concerns.
- to convince, you need ethos (your character), pathos (your relationship to the other) and logos (the logic of your presentation)
- the moment you really understand the other person's ideas, and you can show it to them, you ideas instantly have more credibility.
- habit 4 is the root: thinking win-win, habit 5 is the strategy: first understand, and by following these you get habit 6: synergy
- to be able to practice 4,5,6, you need to be secure about yourself and that comes from h123

Habit 6: synergize
- it is a manifestation of all the other habits put together
- synergy: whole > sum of it's parts
- essence of synergy: value differences - respect them, to build on strengths, compensate for weaknesses
- fully trust other people in your life, don't be protective, possesive or defensive. 
- synergy is what happens in great collaborations with people. 
- many people shut off potential opportunities for synergy because they're afraid to be hurt / exploited. 
- when you bounce off ideas of each others, it's much easier to come up with an idea that you would have had individually
- in relationship, husband and wife have different priorities; and are unable to see each others perspective -- leads to killing of synergy. it makes things worse for both of them. 
	- problem 1: don't have enough deposits to the emotional bank account - so there's a lack of trust
	- problem 2: they're not exploring a third better alterantive (win / win)
- for ideal synergy in this situation, you need to make sure you have enough deposits in the emotional bank account, think win / win and first seek to understand. 
- if you follow above, you will start thinking together and brainstorming potential solutions together in no time.
- always go for win / win instead of compromise. you will find alternatives if you understand fully, and brainstorm together. 
- value differences in opinions. "ohh good, you see it differently, help me see what you see. i value this difference, and this is what helps us synergize better"


Habit 7: sharpen the saw
- don't just grind, take the time to sharpen the saw
- habit 7 is personal PC -- it is preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have: you.
- it involves careful thinking about:
	- physical: exercise, nutrition, stress
	- mental: reading, visualizing, planning
	- social: empathy, synergy
	- spiritual: value clarification, meditation
- we need to exercise all these disciplines regularly and consistently to keep sharpening the saw
- physical:
	- good diet
	- exercise (edurance, flexibility, strength)
- spiritual:
	- understanding your core values
	- reading good philosophy
	- introspect on them
	- meditate everyday
- the mental:
	- read, and think about those ideas. this also help you improve your thinking. this is a ver high leverage activity. 
	- wars are won in the general's tent. you win the war based on your morning routine: reading, writing.
	- in the future, we will have a moment of extreme sorrow. what determines if you'll crumble or dominate it is what you're doing right now. 
- social
	- H4: "I can see that we're approaching this siutation differently. Why don't we agree to communicate until we find a solution that works for the both of us? Would you be willing to do that." H5: "Let me listen to you first. here's how I feel." H6: "let's brainstorm solutions that work for the both of us"
	- script others: tell them about their strengths and what you think they'll succeed at. 
	- if you treat someone as if they have all the potential in the world, they actually become such people. treat everyone with utmost respect. 
- need balance in all these aspects above to be optimal.
- each habit feeds into each other. always think about the natural principles that will help you grow. refine them as you know more about the world.
- don't ever feel guilty about taking time for yourself. you won't be helpful to other if you're not internally stable yourself. 



---

My current evaluation on these habits:
- Habit 1: I believe I've mastered this law. I don't remember the last time I blamed someone else for my situation.
- Habit 2: Begin with end in mind
	- I'm starting to do things in a more organized way by writing my goals now. For example, I have a Notion document that summarizes the directions in which I have to expend my efforts to improve at business. 
- Habit 3: prioritize
	- I'm not doing this very well. I often find myself doing things I'm interested in more, than the things that I need to do.
- Habit 4: think win win
	- This is something I do not do. I try to avoid discussions, more than getting into this.
