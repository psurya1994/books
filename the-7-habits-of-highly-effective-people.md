Inside-out:
- many people who has tremendous outward success struggle with personal relationships, health, effectively managing people, bad children, happiness, meaning.
- quick fixes can't solve these problems
- our lens through which we see the world, massively shapes who we perceive the world
- two fields of thoughts on what leads to success:
	- #1: character ethic: integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty
	- #2: personality ethic: skills, attitudes, behaviors, technique, power strategies, etc.
- most literature sees #2 as necessary and #1 and a good to have on the side. 
- if you want to help you kid lagging behind, you should first stop seeing him as inadequate. you need to change yourself first, before trying to change him. 
	- don't worry more about how others will judge you (because of your kid), rather than genuinely trying to help him. 
	- be driven by #1 instead of #2. instead of focusing on what techniques would work best, focus on how you can change your mental attitude. 
	- enjoy and value him, and you see his personality naturally emerge. 
	- see him as fundamentally capable, and stop trying to protect him with everything. convey the message "you're ok, you don't need your parents protection"
	- how the child feels internally about himself, affects how well he does. the child develops these internal feeling based on how you treat him.
- In true, #1 is primary and #2 is secondary. Develop your personal ethic to build lasting relationships.
- we need an accurate map to be able to navigate the world well. we generally see the world as we've been conditioned, not how it actually is. 
- we generally think we are right, and will be demanding on others. unless some new information comes up that's a paradigm shift. we need to get into a state that we're fully understanding the situation of the other person before demanding from them.
- the principles covered here are fundamental, and part of human nature. 
- principles are different from practices. a suggested practice works in a specific context. principles work everytime, everywhere. 
- principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring value. 
- you will only be able to make slow progress at these principles, there is no quick fix.
- eg. of violation of the principle: telling your friends taht you can play the piano at concert level when you're just a beginner. 
- when you're using #2 techniques without consideration for #1, you're setting yourself up for failure. 
- if your kid is not sharing toys with others, it might be because she needs to expereince possessing things before sharing. try to understand that need, instead of forcing something.
	- if you use strength to get something done, it builds weakness in relationship. if you're not equals, both people become more arbitrary and defensive. 
	- principle: when children get a sense of real possession, they share naturally, freely and spontaneously. it doesn't have to be forced. 
	- there are times to teach, and times to non teach. never teach when the emotions are high.
- these principles are an inside-out approach, which is first trying to change yourself before you try to have influence on otehrs. 
- using outside-in, pushing other people based on their weaknesses, leads to long term suffering. if you think the problem is out there, and if that external thing is solved, it will all be fine, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. 

The 7 habits - overview:
- Our character is a composite of our habits. Habits are unconscious patterns we follow daily to express our character. They influence our effectiveness. 
- Habit: intersection of knowledge (what to do, why to do), skill (how to do) and desire (want to do). 
- progress of a human: dependence -> independence -> interdependence. this happens across all qualities: physical, intellectual, mental, emotionally, etc.
- people think independence is the best thing to have, but that's often because they're vulnerable to worry based on other's behaviors. 
- interdependence is a far more mature state, it is the recognition that we need to come together to build something bigger. you are not vulnerable to the worries of other people anymore. 
- have you to be independent, before you can become interdependent. 
- to produce effectively, you need to have P/PC balance. P: production, PC: production capability. #2 focuses on getting P done at the cost of PC.
	- Maintaining PC is not hard, but once it's lost, getting it back takes a lot of resources. 
- In relationships, keep your focus on PC, keeping your relationship healthy. Do things that you might not want to do otherwise.
- PC principle: treat your employees as you want them to treat your best customers. don't focus on exploiting your employees for all they can give, focus on a more sustainable relationship. focus on getting people to commit to doing things without external supervision. 

Habit 1: Be proactive
- We tend to project our view of the world on others, and call it objective.
- When people say "why can't you solve this easy problem", they are often more projections (than who you truly are)
- We have free will, to exercise the freedom to choose, between stimulus and response.
- Being proactive: taking responsiblity for you own life, without blaming others
- Reactive people are quite vulnerable to what happens around them. When someone says something, their emotional state changes. 
- When you transcend suffering and live by your core values, people are inspired. 
- People who proactively seek more opportunities to solve a problem are the ones who succeed in life.
