Chapter 1: Why practice mindfulness? 
- Being human comes with an inherent dissatisfaction about life. You can supress it for a while, but it will come back. You believe fulfilling a desire will make you eternally happy, but that fades too. [wonderfully framed in the book, need to definitely reread this]
- Our experience keep changing, no two moments are the same. But culture has an odd reponse to this flow of experience. We **grasp** experiences that we deem "good", **ignore** experiences that we deem "boring" and we try to **reject** / rush away experience we deem as "bad". 
- "The essence of life is suffering" - Buddha. All experiences come to an end. 
- Trying to control things which we can't leads to suffering. Recognize desire / fear, but don't chase it. 
- Just being able to see who you are internally without judgment can change your life. 

Chapter 2: What meditation isn't?

Chapter 3: What meditation is?
- Meditate with the intention of finding out about the nature of experience (what is the fundamental reality?) by yourself.
