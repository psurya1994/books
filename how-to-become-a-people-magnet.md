I don't like the book much, felt it was quickly written and not reviewed properly (some of the points were repeating multiple times). It seems like a quick compilation of ideas presented more effective and elaborately in other books. I don't have many take aways from the book.

Intro:
- Dealing with other people well gets you 85% of the way to make progress in the world. Social relationships are number 1 indicator of success.

Part 1: understanding human nature
- #1: Understand people. People are always interested in themselves, not you. That's human nature. 
- #2: People enjoy talking about themselves. Ask questions, and be interested. Use "you" much more than "I". Get them talking about themselves.
	- What do you do when you get free time?
	- How do you feel about [something on topics they are interested in]?
- #3: Make people feel important. Listen closely and give sincere compliments. Recognize and appretiate. Call them by their name. Let them finish their sentence. Give a pause before answer. Give a nod before answering.
- #4: Agree with people. Don't argue even if you're right. Admit mistakes quickly.
	- "I totally agree with you.""
- #5: The first few seconds matter. Smile a lot sincerely. Smile at everyone. Smile even when you're talking on the phone. The meaner someone gets, the nicer you need to get. 
- #6: Making a good impression. Value and admire yourself. Be proud of yourself. Be confident, say what you mean. Don't be over anxious. Never play anyone else down.
- #7: Connecting with people. Understand their interests and talk to them. Greet people, admire people.
- #8: Developing attractive personality. Accept people as they are. No one is perfect, you can't change other people. Just accept as they are. Appretiate them, and be grateful. Write thank you notes. 
- #9: It's what they want, not what you want. To influence them, talk about what they want.

Part 2: communicate effectively
- #10: listen better. listen with eye, ears and the whole body. smile. ask questions. don't suggest answers, people are capable of coming up with them by themselves. 
- #11: know what they like / want. And show them how to do that. ask lots of questions to find.
- #12: convincing people quick. don't directly pitch your idea, do it through others testimonials (this makes them less skeptical). quote stats too. 
- #13: ask two or more yes questions, before you make the request. makes it more likely that they'll say yes. expect people to say yes, and show it in your body langauge.
- #14: focus actions, rather than words. if you say you'll help them, show them in actions. don't tell the interviewer how good you are at code, write a piece and code and show it to them.
- #15: respect other people's opinions.
- #16: be authentic. be you. be open about your flaws and strengths.
- #17: communicate well. don't be afraid of saying something trivial. small talk: it's supposed to be easy, don't try to too hard. Ask about themselves. "where are you from?" "what do you do for living?" etc.
- #18: shift conversation to them. answer but switch back.
- #19: say thank you. be grateful for people. use people's names. 
- #20: admit your mistakes openly. people will trust you more.
- #21: stop gossiping. people think you'll do it behind their back.
- #22: stop judging. we're all human and we all make mistakes.  
- #23: forgive everyone. don't complain.
- #24: keep your word. follow up your words with actions. mean everything you say.
- #25: give without expecting. If a waiter brings a wrong order, say "I'm sorry to trouble you, but I ordered X"
- #26: remember people's names. makes them feel important. just people's name very frequently.
- #27: avoid arguments. just agree.
- #28: praise behaviors of people.
- #29: be kind to everyone.
- #30: give suggestions, not direct orders. let people learn from mistakes. 
- #31: believe in people's potential, even if they're not doing well. ask them how you can help, and how they already have the trait that's needed.
- #32: be an example. do all the things you tell your kids / employees first. 
- #33: be humble. acknowledge limitations. that you don't have a lot of skills that other people do.
- #34: let the other person come up with the idea. give them credit.
- #35: be punctual
- #36: focus on other person's strength. it will help us appretiate them more.

Part 5:
- #37: criticize smoothly. appretiate and their performance will boost. don't communicate when you're angry. 
- #38: criticize in private. praise in public. ask nicely, instead of by force. keep your body language nice and polite.
- #39: handle complaints smoothly. ask them lots of questions, and reframe to understand things better. keep listening.
- #40: Don't use "but" while giving feedback. When you say "but", it negates everything before.
- #41: Be considerable of their feelings.
- #42: If you have to ask someone to do something, tell them it's because you trust them to do this well, or that you will give them a better project in future. "Peter, if you could do X and Y, it will really make us help a good case for our clients"
- #43: Watch your body language. Have positive, or mirror. 
- #44: Recognize worth of everyone. convince yourself that other people are important.
- #45: Talk about your own mistakes first before you criticize someone else.
