geohot's insights on programming:

Programming: input -> computation -> output

Software engineering: they often don't write algorithms. They use looks like Ruby on Rails / React (which is memorizing lots of commands to do quickly) to implement web apps. Web apps are basically CRUD (create, read, update, delete). This is trash work!

Competitive programming is just pattern recognition, it's not fun once you figure out how to do things. This and CTFs are fun, but once you learn the patterns, it's time to stop doing them.

High brow SE: understand a complex system, add features, ship new system. (do enough repetitions on CRUD to get good at this)

ML engineer: download a paper, implement it, keep doing this repeatedly. You get better at implementing papers quickly. 

- Always learn meta level skills. Do not waste time learning object llevel skills, because those skills will die out when the tools die out. Don't waste you time working for companies doing that sort of thing. 

- If you're using company specific tools that can't be generalized once you're outside, don't do them.

- Anything tool specific that you're learning, is just a waste of time.
