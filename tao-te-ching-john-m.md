Tao Te Ching with commentary:

Introduction:
- Taoism has a lot of historical context, and has worked for a lot of people.
- There is a healthier way to live life: softer, gentler and kinder. This can be acheived by living in harmony with, not in rebellion against, the laws of nature.
	- [surya]: laws of nature show that some people betray, we will all die someday, etc. accept them as they as, feel content with these laws, and you will find the tao.
	- [surya]: all this have a spirit (way in which they need to act), accepting that spirit and letting things play themselves out is the way to tao.


- The true nature of Tao can be communicated only through living it.
