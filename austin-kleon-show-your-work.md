Show your work:

Summary
- This book argues for the importance of showing your work online. It opens up opportunities that can completely change the trajectory of your life. For this to happen, your work needs to be findable. Making your work findable is about just posting snippents of your work as you're cranking away in your cubicle building your craft. 

Chapter 1:
- People who seem like lone geniuses (eg. Mozart, Einestein and Picasso) ere actually a part a group of people who support / copy / steal each other from each other. Showing your work can help you find this group of geniuses who you can grow together with. Be generous and help other people who're trying to do similar things but not at the cost of your growth.
- Be okay to put our amateurish work. Be proud when you do that, doing something is better than doing nothing. This kind of work could inspire people more than the experts work because people can relate to this more. 
- Show your enthusiasm and passion for the work you do. This is contagious. 

Chapter 2, 3:
- When you make stuff, take photos, record videos, talk into the camera enthusiastically. Go through these clips at the end of the week and share relavent things online.
- Ideas of what you can post: your progress on a project, your influences / inspirations, methods, final product, what you learnt, etc. In my case, they could be: review for a book I read, exercise routines, photos with people who I have inspiring conversations with, some thoughts I get, something you're proud of, 
- "don't show your lunch or latte, show your work"
- Plagarism can completely fuck up your life. Bend over backward to credit people. And be charitable when you present other people's views. 
- Tell good stories: initial problem, work you did to solve the problem, the solution.



Other thoughts:
- If you're a introvert, this is the most efficient way to build a network instead of going to networking event. Be very good at your art, and show this online. You're going to attract a huge network of likeminded people who will reach out to you. 
- Be proud to make mistakes. Be proud to put yourself in embarassing situations. Who cares what other people think. Make this a significant part of your identity. It relieves you from having your gaurd up all the time. Don't stick to mental models of what other people think of you, that just limits your personality, keep breaking them.
- Be careful about what you share. Don't get into politics, religion, patriotism, race, etc., type conversations unless you're informed and you know what you're getting into. The internet has a long memory! Anything you say can be used against you. Lauren Cerand: "Post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you"
