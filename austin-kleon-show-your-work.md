Show your work:

Summary
This book argues for the importance of showing your work online. Sharing opens up opportunities that can completely change the trajectory of your life. For this to happen, your work needs to be findable. Making your work findable is about just posting snippents of your work as you're cranking away in your cubicle building your craft. I'd give this book a 6/10. A few interesting points here and there. Remaining sounded obvious. 

Chapter 1:
- People who seem like lone geniuses (eg. Mozart, Einestein and Picasso) ere actually a part a group of people who support / copy / steal each other from each other. Showing your work can help you find this group of geniuses who you can grow together with. Be generous and help other people who're trying to do similar things but not at the cost of your growth.
- Be okay to put our amateurish work. Be proud when you do that, doing something is better than doing nothing. This kind of work could inspire people more than the experts work because people can relate to this more. 
- Show your enthusiasm and passion for the work you do. This is contagious. 

Chapter 2, 3:
- When you make stuff, take photos, record videos, talk into the camera enthusiastically. Go through these clips at the end of the week and share relavent things online.
- Spend 10 minutes per day compiling content that you can show to other people. This is more important than getting 10 extra minutes of sleep.
- Ideas of what you can post: your progress on a project, your influences / inspirations, methods, final product, what you learnt, etc. In my case, they could be: review for a book I read, exercise routines, photos with people who I have inspiring conversations with, some thoughts I get, something you're proud of, 
- A lot of ideas in thhis book started as tweets, then blog posts and then book chapters. Posting these small chunks add up over time into something much bigger.
- "don't show your lunch or latte, show your work"

Chapter 4:
- As amateurs, if we don't have a lot of work to share, we should share out thought about the works of others. Things like: inspiration, brain space thoughts, books I'm reading, notes from my book, about people you admire, who you steal ideas from, your heros, etc.,
- We love things others think are garbage. But we should have to courage to continue our love towards them. When you love something, don't let anyone else make you feel bad about it. Celebrate and share the things you enjoy. 
- Give shoutouts to people often. Always err on the side of giving people more credit.

Chapter 5: 
- Learn to tell good stories: initial problem, work you did to solve the problem, the solution.
- "So who are you, and what do you do?" Have prepared answers for these kinds of questions. Have empathy and anticipate blank stares. But continue to be enthusiastic. My answer: "I'm a masters student at McGill, and I work on making machine smart by studying the brains of animals to see what makes them smart. Beyond my main line of work, I have a YouTube channel and a podcast. I love spending my time with read, write, meditate, exercise."

Chapter 6, 7:
- Share your secrets. The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Create tutorials and post them online. Help people get better at what they want to get better at. 
- Don't worry about how many people follow you. Focus on the quality of them. Empathize with them, and understand how you can add more value to them.
- Network can grow naturally when you do good work. Don't waste time going to networking events trying to build connections if you don't have good work to show, 
- Make stuff you love, talk about stuff you love and you'll attract people who love that kind of stuff.
- Don't hangout with vampires. Vampires are people who make you feel worn out and depleted after spending time with them.
- Identify people who share your values about the work you do. Do what you can to nuture these relationships. Sing their praises to the univers. Invite them to collaborate. Show them the work before you show others. Call them on phone and share your secrets. Keep them as close as you can.

Chapter 9, 10:
- Celebrate victory of your friends as if it were your own.
- Once you have a dedicated audience, converting it to money is not a big deal. It's as simple as starting a gofundme page. Keep a mailing list though, it will come in handy.
- You can't count on success, you can only be ready to jump when it comes. 



Other thoughts:
- If you're a introvert, this is the most efficient way to build a network instead of going to networking event. Be very good at your art, and show this online. You're going to attract a huge network of likeminded people who will reach out to you. 
- Plagarism can completely fuck up your life. Bend over backward to credit people. And be charitable when you present other people's views. 
- Be proud to make mistakes. Be proud to put yourself in embarassing situations. Who cares what other people think. Make this a significant part of your identity. It relieves you from having your gaurd up all the time. Don't stick to mental models of what other people think of you, that just limits your personality, keep breaking them.
- Be careful about what you share. Don't get into politics, religion, patriotism, race, etc., type conversations unless you're informed and you know what you're getting into. The internet has a long memory! Anything you say can be used against you. Lauren Cerand: "Post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you"
