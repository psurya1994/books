## Learning and Goal-Setting with Michael Simmons

### On reading books:

- Higher your bar for the books that you read. For example, reading books from every successful entreprenuer is a bad idea because many of them are there just because of luck. You have limited time, so only read good books. 

- Big entreprenuers (bill gates, elon, warren, etc.) are voracious readers since they were young. They're also polymaths because of these habits. 

- Simple strategy to be smarter: read as many good books as possible. It almost gets you there!

- Strategies to read more: 
	- read 3-4 hours in the morning on weekends
	- read 1 hour everyday
	- take week off just to read every year
	- listen to audio books and podcasts

### On learning

- Efficient ways to learn about new fields:
	- highest cited papers on google scholar
	- read systematic reviews
	- to learn about cutting edge economics, (i) read basic economics textbooks and then latest papers, (ii) you could find one expert and see what he says or (iii) you could find multiple experts and see what they agree on. (ii), (iii) are generally more efficient

- Adverserial collabs: the scientific community needs to do more of it. Example: Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree by Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein. Read the paper!

### Writing

- Simple tip to improve writing: (i) see what topic the best essayist wrote, (ii) write your own version using similar arguments, (iii) compare differences.

- Counter intuitve ideas about writing: people tend to spend 1 hour writing each article vs spending 100 hours writing better articles. Later is much more likely to help people and go viral. Former tends not to add much value. You could use former (cheap experiments) to just see how people respond before honing much more deeply into one. 

- In practice, to explain to the masses, we need simple models. But you lose accuracy. A good way to guide yourself in this tradeoff: value-density -- how much value are you giving to your reader per minute. 

- When you find something hard to learn, it's an opportunity to write that article that's explains the thing better.

- "I want to write the best article possible for this narrow group of people on this narrow topic", it's much easier than most people think. And "best" by my internal evaluation. 

### On marketing

- When you want to do something (say write a best seller book, or title for blog post, or learning basketball), watch what the best people are doing, extract and recognize patterns. 

- How to sell ideas? Good ideas are not enough. People find your ideas on newsfeed: title, image, subtitle. You need to master these things to go viral. 

- You have to have a good idea, then also package it so that people want to consume it. You need both. Given people's attention spans, they'd never find it otherwise. 

- Marketing ideas is not unethical. Simplest way: tell them why this is worth their time. make them curious (and deliver on it). This is highly Ethical. 

- Marketing -- top people recommend older books (1930s). Why? The cost of running experiments was high, so they needed really good theory to guide experiments. Now, with internet, the testing has become more empirical (generate 100 titles and use google ads) instead of building good theory.

- There are lots of high value areas where very little work is done (for example, quite by Susain Cain). Especially once you start learning across areas you see more clearly.

### On being an expert

- You can only be "best in the world" at one very precise thing for just one audience. 

- Lean startup -- pick an area that you know best, create a rapid prototype, put it out there in the world, based on feedback iterate and improve. Pitfall: too much focus on doing quick and iteratively, but not on doing the best it has ever been done.

### Life, goals and values

- Local vs global optimization. you need to be good at both to be successful. if not, you'll be stuck at a deadend very soon. peak that's not high -- stuck. keep alternating. 

- Self-esteem depends hugely on who you spend time with! M. Simmons feels that way. Because he spends time with smarter people.

- Goal-based thinking: have a goal, split it into mini goals (SMART), visualize, plan, schedule. 
	- Dunning-kruger, planning fallacy make this hard. There's way more steps than you initially realized. It's easy to be overly optimistic or over predict what you achevie.
	- Affects self esteem.
	- Times changes goals in unexpected ways. It feels hard to let go of publicly stated goals. 

- Reshift focus instead of narrow minded goal-based thinking:
	- Spend 20% of your time learning new things, reading books feels like a waste of time. Becase you're producing less. (can be seen as the third part of expanding your horizon in the local/ global optim frameowkr)
	- Curiosity / novelty focus helps because you enjoy when you see new opportunities. Instead of feeling bad about them or feel like they're distraction (biggest inventions like penicilin come up because of like this). Long term goals limits cashing on these opportunities.
	- Further reading: "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned"

- Better ways to think and plan:
	- We could derive goals from our values instead. Spencer's values: do good in the world, do good to my community, do good to myself. Balance three of those things correctly. Use thought experiments to guide the balance. "if I could do extra X good, am I willing to work extra Y hours a day?" Take this to understand your values: https://programs.clearerthinking.org/intrinsic_values_test.html
	- We need to understand what drives us. One way is to have thought experiments, how would I feel about (i) doing something great for (7bil) people but no one knows about it, (ii) people know me, but it doesn't add mcuh value ot most people (100m), (iii) some value to a small set of peopele (100k). None is superior, but knowing it can help make more efficient plans. 

- People often regret not respecting their deeper values. We need to choose behaviour based on our deeper values instead of how other people are going to judge us. We, of course, don't want to be socially osctacized, but generally people prioritize this way too much. Especially looking to impress people who we don't like / people who don't share our values.

- When we're hungry, we think food is one of the most important things. When we're poor, we think that about money. But these motivations change once you hit a basic level. Example in my own life: you want freedom to pursue dreams (when you don't have self time) but complete freedom is not optimal either (I just need some basic space). I want some recognition / fame, but not too much.

- You need skill + attention. Just skills can't get you far. Only people who have both can get far in life because they get better opportunities to hone their skills.
