Preface:
- The most valuable posesssion is our free will, on how we respond to difficult situations. 
- We need to balance 4 things: personal life, relationships, work life, social contributions. By focusing on the one that is out of alignment at that moment. 
	- You never want to spend time with a person who is too busy to meet a project deadline at work, they don't give you their attention. 
- Spirituality is very important to have control over your life. 

Background: 
- [C1] Going up a high raise building of 100 floors become much easier when you're doing it with friends and family as you can keep having fun in the process cracking jokes. These are the memories that you'd most cherish looking backwards. 
	- We all have that one friend who makes jokes at his expense, this makes it much more fun for everyone else.
- [C2] Long hours of doing work you don't enjoy takes a toll on your relationships. 
- [C3] To solve someone's problem, just have a compassionate ear and hear out to people (before you suggest any solution). They want you to understand. 

Wheel 1: personal life 
- Train our mind to focus on the positives, when we face challenges. That can help us think clearly. Focus on gratitude, and practice it. 
- When a friend is suffering, first understand them thoroughly before making any suggestions.  
- When you go through extreme situations (close family member having cancer), what saves you is your family and your spiritual practice.
- Pause and reflect on your life regularly. 
- The richest people tend to exclude parts of life that are not directly realted to hard work and wealth. 
- Living in gratitude is a joy like no other. 

Wheel 2: relationships
- If we don't put work in the relationships, they drift. We have to treat the other person with sensitivity and respect.
- Treats other better than you'd like to be treated yourself. 
- If the treat the objects around us with disrespect, that'll creep into how we treat other humans.
- 

Summary:

Life is about balancing 4 things in life: personal life, relationships, work life and social contributions.
