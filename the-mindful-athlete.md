Summary:
The book was okay, I did not learn any major new ideas; but it reiterates the belief that mindfulness is a key factor even if you want to perform well at sports. I don't think it was that well written or well organized (and bought into some pseudoscience such as: Tai Chi is real). If you're in the middle of a high pressure game, anchor yourself to your breath to ground yourself so that you can start performing optimally without focusing on the response. 

- The trick to get better is not to work harder. There is great power in non-action and non-thinking. It helps improve focus in ways very few things can. 
- Respond and adapt to what's happening, instead of reacting or fighting against it. 
- A lot of chronic pain management is about being aware of the pain instead of ignoring it. Mindfulness is the key to be aware of the pain. Chronic pain gets worse if you ignore it and distract yourself from it. 
- The five superpowers: mindfulness, concentration, insight, right effort, trust. Buddhism's threefold training: mindfulness, concentration and insight.
- Focusing on your breath is all you need. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for relaxation and slowing down your body. 
- The key when you're playing a game admist commotion is to use your breath as an anchor to stay in the present moment. 
- Awareness of breaht can also help injuries and the fears attached to them. 
- For the brain, mentally reharsing something is as good as experinecing it in reality (which is why visualization works). To visualize, get into a relaxed state by focusing on the breath, before visualizing some play move in detail.
- To learn motor skills like riding a cycle, you have to do it mindfully. 
- Intention matters. It's easy to make it to the NBA if you have the intent. 
- All top atheletes have clear intention and a sense of purpose. What do I really want? What is my life for? Ask yourself in silence and you will have the answer. 
- Physical limitations are not the limiting factor. It's the deliberate intentional mindful practice that matters. 
- Practicing something 20 hours a day is not enough if you have to perform at the world class level. We need more reps than that. 
- Mindfulness helps you keep going when you're not motivated and you have a negative self talk. Mindfulness helps detach from it. 
- Without a sense of urgency, you will have trouble sustaining world class effort. Push yourself everyday to get incremental changes. 
- Mindfulness for a few minutes before the game is just as important as the practice. The best way to score is to not think about scoring. 
- Push yourself incrementally mindfully. 
- If beating someone drives you, it won't be sustainable. Focus on your thing instead. 
- If you're putting the right effort, your energy levels will go up not down. 
- Mindfulness of the court helps on court performance.
