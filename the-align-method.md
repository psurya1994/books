The Align Method

Foreword:
- Kelly S argues that the body can recover at any age, and the principle are quite simple that everyone knows. Consistency is the key though. This book clearly conveys those simple principles and give you a good framework to think about health.

Introduction:
- The way you move matters more than supplements, diet trends, etc.
- After years of working on body building, the author started to suffer: dislocating joints, chronic back pain and a feeling of disconnection with his body. => looks don't give a picture of the internal state of the body
- merging movement awareness into daily life / every moment helps you align yourself well with your body
- The modern environment no long forms strong flexible and aligned bodies.
- you might not see an immediate difference, but everything matters because it adds up. 


Chapter 1: Posture and personality
- Posture not only affects how others perceive you, but also how you perceive yourself. Eg. being in a hunched over position while talking affects your self-confidence. You also have uplifting memories when you stay in a good posture. 
- You can tell a person's muscle state by their emotional state. If you're feeling tense, your muscles will be tense. 
- Physical self-awareness is the first step to relive yourself from the tyranny of the past.
- We need to keep "shaking off" the stress / micro-traumas we come across in our lives. If we don't shake it off, it carries into other activities during the day. One way to shake it off is to have good posture. If we don't shake them off, they result in posture collapse, sleep disruption, join pain, unhealthy food cracings, disease and negative self-talk.
- Our endocrine system reads our postures, and changes our moods based on it. high-power poses for 2 mins boost testosterone by 20% and reduce cortisol by 25%. low-power poses (hunching over to your phone) do the opposite.
- The way you walk determines if you'll be looted or not. Things like pace of walking, posture, body language and awareness of environment matter
- event -> cry -> sadness; event -> angry -> strike -- wrong sequence
- event -> sadness -> cry; event -> strike -> angry
- Postural archetypes: 
	- The way someone walks gives us an insight into their personality. 
	- #1: Mopey
		- low energy walk, hunched => depressed. 
		- movement tip: do outward / opening stretches, weight lifting
	- #2: Anxious
		- short breaths, raised shoulders
		- movement tip: gut massage
- Action steps:
	- Each time you're stressed about something: use moditication of the box-style breathing / take a walk / stretch
	- Hang from a bar. Climb trees. Smile.
	- Move the way you want to feel:
		- think about how you want to feel
		- visualize how that moving looks like
		- take a walk just like the way you visualized
		- notice how you feel
	- try a wide range of physical movements: dancing, yoga, lifting, MMA, etc.

Takeaway: Posture affects personality, not the other way around.

[the book is not that great, so I'm going to get through the rest of hte book faster.]

Chapter 2:
- be enthusiastic and play. don't tighten up. play like kids: doing weird movements as you live an imaginary world. 
- create your own playful warmup movements
- engage in movements when you play (that's why you learn better when you write on paper for knowledge work)
- drop your gaurad and feel unadultrated wonder.
- be like curious children, do not grow up. 
- “We spend our most developmental years hunched over a desk under artificial lights, in tight, unventilated schools and buildings, in an overly synthetic, chemically sterilized environment, and repeat the same debilitating pattern in college and many typical workplaces.”

Takeaways: Be like a child and play. Build new skills such as dance and BJJ.

Chapter 3:
- pain in specfic areas of the body might just be a problem of mindfulness. 
- soft tissue forms itself based on the demands of your life. you need to use all parts of your body well for it to develop. 
- trust your feeling to get up and move. it reduces disease.
- be aware of your internal state: emotional and physical. 

Takeaways: talks about hoe to stretch and some specific stretch ideas.

PART 2

Chapter 4: floor sitting
- sitting exercises in the gym don't hit all your muscles, you already sit a lot. don't sit in the gym too.
- study: people who can sit and stand with least contact points are less likely to die
- spend more time on the floor each day. they increase flexibility. (don't use the standing desks for too long)
- contrites that spend more time on the ground have much lesset osteoarthiritis.
- countries in the blue zone don't go to the gym: they instead squat, lunge, walk, play football, etc. 
- exercise distributed through the whole day is much better than 
- doing the exercises mindfully whist thinking about their benefits is important
- if you want to do something distracting, sit on the floor and do it for the next 30 days (eg. youtube, take phone calls, etc.) *

Takeaways: do the stretches you enjoy. you don't have to go overboard at the gym, try to instead incorporate these into your daily life naturally.  

Chapter 5: breathing
- breath is a remote control to your nervous system. 
- always braeth through nose if you want to stay calm. breating through mouth shows elevated estress in the body that could help for short runs, but not for sustained activity. 
- mouth breathing makes us more exhausted than normal
- breaht only though your nose during your workouts * us mouth breathing only if you want to go to final gear.
- taking 6 breaths instead of 10-14 can really improve your parasympethic nervous system.
- don't breathe with your mouth open:
	- it signals to your brain that you're tired and your body will shut off earlier
	- it causes instability in form and great risk of injury
- take deep breath before deadlift
- if you want to gear, breath faster
- action steps:
	- do typical exercises with correct breathing pattern

- thoughts:
	- to be more productive, i need to be more maindful and calm and put my energy on the right things. sitting on the floor for an hour and doing some activity can be incredibly helpful for this. 
	- adding other things to my routine: at every moment remember that all that matter is what you're doing now, and that's enough to keep you permanenetly hapy.

Chapter 6: hip hinging
- see each moment as an opportunity to get better.
- always hinge from your hips instead of collapsing your spine. squatting and deadlifting are a small drop compared to doing this consistently. 
- L5-S1 discs are most vulnerable to backpain. Sitting in a stair chair minimizes the stress / load on it.
- when sitting, have your back straight, 20% core engaged. 
- your neck shouldn't hinge forward
- when we breath out, our core is tigher. that's when we need to breath out when we're lifting. it gives more stability to the torso.

Chapter 7: hanging
- we evolved to hang and pull
- regular hanging and basic bumbell exercises solve 99 percent of shoulder pain
- focus on improving your grip strength when you hang

Chapter 8: walking
- study: walking atleast 6 hour massively reduces lots of risks. but what if you have pain when you walk a lot?
- imagine a band between your shoulder and opposite ankle, when you're running the tendons act as springs. All the internal tendons that act together must be in working state. if any one is too tight or lose, you have pain and increased likelihood of injury. how to fix them?
	- ankle mobility: ankle strech (hits the posterior muscles too)
	- lunge overhead stretch
	- banded quad stretch
- study: improves learning, prevents cognitive decline
- use <4mm heel-to-toe drop shoes, they aer best for your foot when walking. be bare foor at home whenever possible.  
- we're depriving the brain of sensory information from the foot, we shouldn't do that. it is directl associated with low-back issues
- exercise: venus fly trap for your foot

PART 3: environment forms your mind

------


Background:
- I decided to read this book as the forwerd was written by Kelly S. The books in the space of diet and exercise are hard to judge for me, so I go by expert opinions who have active experience of workign with a lot of people. Firas Zahabi has given a stuggin endorsal of this book of Kelly, and he wrote the forward so I read the book
- Other thoughts:
	- Mentions studies such as grip strength, but doesn't say anything about the difference between correlation and causation. grip strength -> people die less from cardiovascular. Maybe it's the other way around?
	- Alignband -> over marketing. 

Distractions:
- Read The Body Keeps the Score.
