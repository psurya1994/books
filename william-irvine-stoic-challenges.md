## The Stoic Challenge by William B. Irvine

### Summary
This book explains a technique on how we can reframe setbacks to minimize any misery that it may produce. The ideas here are not novel (specially because I already read William's 2008 book), but putting them in the Stoicism framework helps me as I can internalize things more easily. 

### Takeaways

- How can we minimize misery during setbacks / challenges? 
	- See challenges as an opportunity in this first person video game to practice your Stoicism. See them as something the Stoic gods have bestowed upon us to test our resilience. 
	- Each time things get worse, say "what a clever wrinkle! I hadn't seen this coming. Well played Stoic gods, just watch how I'm going to handle this." (refered as the Stoic test strategy)
	- At the end of the challenge, rate yourself on the Stoic sage scale. 
	- The Stoic goal is not to stay calm through suffering, it is to experience setbacks without any suffering. It is a big difference.
	- The purpose of life is to see these challenges as a game with the Stoic gods where you want to maximize your Stoicism points. 

- On setbacks:
	- Setbacks are unavoidable, internalize this idea through negative visualization! Level 1: burn your finger, spilling water on your laptop, late for a meeting because you're stuck in traffic, etc. | Level 2: losing your job | Level 3: death of a loved one, imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit
	- You need to develop strategies to minimize harm done when unforeseeable setbacks happen. Emotional distress caused by setbacks is worse than the setbacks themselves. 
	- Talking about setbacks can reignite the anger and frustration. Such people are not good companions. Don't be one of them. 
	- Why do people talk about setbacks? (a) public service, to inspire others, (b) to request for help, (c) to join have more people just them in the fight against injustice, (d) seek others empathy / pity. 
	- All the little discomforts we whine over, our ancestor would be super grateful for. People have gone through much worse before us, and they have handled it with great courage. 

- On anger:
	- Getting frustrated about setbacks begets anger which only makes things worse. We sometimes complain to get other people riled up with us. It is foolish for one person to get angry, elt alone two people.
	- When we (as Stoics) complain, we should be okay if other people feint feeling bad. The last thing we want is to have other people feel bad with us.
	- It is possible to not feel angry at perceived injustices done to us. The first step is to recognize that anger only makes things worse.
	- Would you have been better off by being angry at your colleague who called you stupid, or by avoiding to be angry at all? Reframing the situation, maybe he had a rough day, he doesn't want to cause me suffering, he's just an uninsightful person who fails to see that being angry at me doesn't serve anything. Or the biggest reframe, maybe the Stoic gods are testing your practice of Stoicism. 
	- Anger has a very short half life, it's the repeated replay of the situation that reignites the physiological phenomenon of anger. 

- On resilience:
	- People bounce right off setbacks because they feel anger. Stoic sage wouldn't need to bounce because they weren't upset to begin with.
	- Getting setbacks of your head, and being sane (with 0 negative emotions) when people expect you to be angry / upset / disappointed about something is admirable. Example: Neil Armstrong's crash landing; his colleaugues expected him to booast / complain how it happened, but he had nothing much to say other than a couple of facts.
	- When the number of options is limited, it is foolish to fret. We should choose the best of them and get ahead with life. 
	- Don't play the victim and complain. These kinds of people are not fun to be around.

- Conscious vs sub-conscious
	- Try to not think about anything for a minute. The thoughts that are popping into your brain are planted by the subconscious. 
	- The concious mind and subconscious work together to make decisions. The subconscious has an unfair advantage, it can repeatedly recommend things to the consicious brain. It's a losing battle. How can you stop the subconscious from triggering negative emotions and poping these finger pointing thoughts when you face setbacks? By reframing it as a Stoic test. 
	- The default mode of the subconscious during setbacks is to abdicate responsibility and point fingers. It create unnecessary thoughts (maybe I should have responded saying X), unnecessary replays (of the event perceived as an injustice) and unnecessary negative emotions (like anger).
	- Treating / framing the setback as a Stoic test, is a great way to stop the subconscious from doing this. It can infact be a source of pride, satisfaction or joy.

- On anchoring and framing:
	- Framing effect: how we mentally characterize the situation has profound impact on how we respond to it emotionally. | Anchoring effect: dropping anchors can affect our estimates / foresight. 
	- Negative visualization is a form of anchoring to reclibrate your expectations from life. Lower your expectations is a reliable way to become happier. 
	- Marcus - "If you are distress by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but your estimate of it; and you have the power to revoke this at any moment."
	- Frames you can use (i) competing obligations, (ii) incompetence, (iii) story telling (this adversity makes for a good story I can tell in future), (iv) comedic frame (when a bad thing outside our control happens, say "Well, then, let's have some beer."), (v) game frame (play this like a video game with friends; use all adversity as an excuse for laughter). Other frames (i) 5-min free will frame, (ii) a documentary videographer following you frame. 
	- Be an optimistic delightful enthusiastic person who sees the bright side in everything by reframing setbacks. That's the kind of person who increases tranquility in the world, and the Stoic gods would appretiate.

- We need to learn two main things: (i) control for possible worst case scenarios, (ii) prevent feeling negative emotions after a setback.
- When you're stuck in the traffic and late for an important meeting, listen to your podcast happily. Don't worry about things that are out of yoru control.
- When we experience a setback, our immediate goal is to prevent a flood of negative emotions. (not conceal)
- If we want to cause change in society, being angry prevents progress. Gandhi and Martin Luther King recognized this. MLK regretted being angry on people at both sides while negotiating a deal. "I quickly regretted being angry, this way no way to solve a problem. You must not harbor anger. You must be willing to suffer teh anger of your opponenet, and yet not return anger. You must not become bitter. No matter how emotional your opponents are, you must be calm." Righteous anger can retard progress on the issue in question. 
- Social reformers would be wise to follow Gnadhi and King, and stay calm while working passionately to bring change.

- the key to being robust to suffering is going through hard times and praticing Stoicism in the process. Anyone who isn't practicing Stoicism, and not encountering much hardship in his life is setting himself up for a big failure. It's okay to focus on avoiding hard situations, but you need to include them in a controlled way in your life if the Stoic gods don't put it on you.

-replaying bad things as you worry is natural, but bad. Reframe things, so that the replay and the emotion it triggers would reduce massivel.y
- Seneca - god is like a strict fatherwho hardens his favourites through the stoictest.
Epictetus - god has given us a part of himself (the adbility to reason). that is enough to avoid most suffering.




List of possible bad things that can happen:
- you lose both of your front teeth on the morning of your marriage.
- shark biting off one of your arm
- locked in syndrome: you're in the prime of your life, but you suddenlt fall our. A few weeks later, you wake up in the hospital and can't move a muscle. This means no french fries, no marriage, no exercise, no reading, no anything!
- getting covid and lung capacity going to 50%
- becoming blind

- I'm already in a good position in my life. Instead of trying to do things that will take me ot the next level, I want to completely be happy here first. And handle the worst case scenarios that could be caused of big miseries in my life. (when in doubt, always handle the worst case scenarios; don't gamble on your life)
- As stoics, we shouldn't boast or try to flatter someone. (except for potential partners maybe?)
- Excellence withers wihtout adversity. You need it if you want to reach tranquility.
- The Stoic gods have a mischievous sense of humor. Instead of casuing your phone to stop working, they put it in a lemonade because that is more fun.
- The gods who administer the stoic test don't grade them, you have to do it yourself. 
	- Actions. Ask things like: before commiting to a action did you consider your options? Did you engage in lateral thinking? Was your workaround optimal?
	- Internals. Were you calm? That's a B. To get A, you need to enjoy that you're getting a chance to test out / demo your capabilities. Smile at the Stoic gods. Humor yourself.

- 5 second rule:
	- If we encounter a setback, we have 5-seconds to declare this as a Stoic test. This can help not the emotional response of anger be triggered. 
- What is unpleasant for most people can turn into fun for us.





Example: 
- Person X not treating me with the respect I deserve. He's not seeing the value I'm adding to his life. That's okay, this is what the Stoic gods have bestowed upon you. Don't give unsolicited advice to that person in future. He's not impressed, that's maybe because what you say aren't as insightful "to him" as much as you think they are.  
Grading my setback:
- Behaviourally, I did a decent job. Fixed my mistakes in a decent way. That's a B. It's kinda like I defended by honor. The Stoics wouldn't start with creating a model of themselves that force sthem to have their gaurd up which is what I did.
