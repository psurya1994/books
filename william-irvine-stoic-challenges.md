- See challenges as an opportunity in this first person video game to practice your Stoicism. See them as something the Stoic gods have bestowed upon us to test our resilience. 
- Each time things get worse, say "what a clever wrinkle! I hadn't seen this coming. Well played Stoic gods, just watch how I'm going to handle this." (refered as the Stoic test strategy)
- Handle things with peace. If anger as the last resort, and only feint it. 
- All the little discomforts we whine over, our ancestor would be super grateful for.
- framing effect: how we mentally characterize the situation has profound impact on how we respond to it emotionally. 
- At the end of the challenge, rate yourself on the Stoic sage scale. 
- The Stoic goal is not to stay calm through suffering, it is to experience setbacks without any suffering. It is a big difference.

Part 1:
- Setbacks:
	- Unexpected things happen! Level 1: burn your finger, spilling water on your laptop, late for a meeting because you're stuck in traffic, etc. | Level 2: losing your job | Level 3: death of a loved one, imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit
	- Setbacks can happen from nature, other people intentionally, other people inadvertently or yourself (you're on the top of this list). You cause setbacks in other people's lives too. 
	- Setbacks and desires are related. Depending on your desire, you see a setback as a mere annoyance or a major setback. 0 desire = 0 setbacks. 
	- Number of setbacks = F(foresight you possess). But even with great foresight, setbacks are unavoidble. 
	- You need to develop strategies to minimize harm done when unforeseeable setbacks happen. Emotional distress caused by setbacks is worse than the setbacks themselves. 
	- Talking about setbacks can reignite the anger and frustration. Such people are not good companions. Don't be one of them. 
	- Why do people talk about setbacks? (a) public service, to inspire others, (b) to request for help, (c) to join have more people just them in the fight against injustice, (d) seek others empathy / pity. 
	- Sometimes watching people we don't like (or even competing) being setback can be rewarding.
- Anger:
	- Getting frustrated about setbacks begets anger only makes things worse. We sometimes complain to get other people riled up with us. It is foolish for one person to get angry, elt alone two people.
	- When we (as Stoics) complain, we're okay if other people feint feeling bad. But the last thing we want is to have other people feel bad with us.
	- It is possible to not feel angry at perceived injustices done to us. THe first step is to recognize that anger only makes things wors.e 
	- Would you have been better off by being angry at your colleague who called you stupid, or by avoiding to be angry at all. Reframing the situation, maybe he had a rough day, he doesn't want to cause me suffering, he's just an uninsightful person who fails to see that being angry at me doesn't serve anything. AVoiding anger is clearly the way to go.
	- Anger can take over you by replaying event. 
	- If we can deal with setbacks would anger, there wouldn't be any anger left to deal with.
- Resilience:
	- People bounce right off setbacks because they feel anger. Stoic sage wouldn't need to bounce because they weren't upset to begin with.
	- Getting setbacks of your head, and being sane (with 0 negative emotions) when people want you to be angry / upset / disappointed about something is admirable. (Example, Neil Armstrong's crash landing. His colleaugues expected him to booast / complain how well he did, but he had nothing much to say other than a couple of facts.)
	- When the number of options is limited, it is foolish to fret. We should choose the best of them and get ahead with life.
	- (include highlisths from chapter 4)
- Two minds
	- The concious mind and subconscious work together to make decisions. The subconscious has an unfair advantage, it can repeatedly recommend things to the consicious brain. It's a losing battle. How can you stop the subconscious from triggering negative emotions and poping these finger pointing thoughts when you face setbacks? By reframing it as a Stoic test. 

- negative visualization is a form of anchoring to reclibrate your expectations frmo life. 
- Framing things the right way can also help us appretiate the setbacks we come across with joy. 
- Marcus - "If you are distress by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but your estimate of it; and you have the power to revoke this at any moment."
- Frames you can use (i) competing obligations, (ii) incompetence, (iii) story telling, (iv) comedic frame. Other frames (i) 5-min free will frame, (ii) a documentary videographer following you frame. 
- Be an optimistic delightful person, that's the kind of person who increases tranquility in the world. 

- when you're stuck in the traffic and alte, listen to your podcast happily. Don't worry about things that are out of yoru conotrl.

- the key to being robust to suffering is going through hard times and praticing Stoicism in the process. Anyone who isn't practicing Stoicism, and not encountering much hardship in his life is setting himself up for a big failure. It's okay to focus on avoiding hard situations, but you need to include them in a controlled way in your life if the Stoic gods don't put it on you.

-replaying bad things as you worry is natural, but bad. Reframe things, so that the replay and the emotion it triggers would reduce massivel.y
- Seneca - god is like a strict fatherwho hardens his favourites through the stoictest.
Epictetus - god has given us a part of himself (the adbility to reason). that is enough to avoid most suffering.




List of possible bad things that can happen:
- you lose both of your front teeth on the morning of your marriage.
- shark biting off one of your arm
- locked in syndrome: you're in the prime of your life, but you suddenlt fall our. A few weeks later, you wake up in the hospital and can't move a muscle. This means no french fries, no marriage, no exercise, no reading, no anything!
- getting covid and lung capacity going to 50%
- becoming blind

- I'm already in a good position in my life. Instead of trying to do things that will take me ot the next level, I want to completely be happy here first. And handle the worst case scenarios that could be caused of big miseries in my life. (when in doubt, always handle the worst case scenarios; don't gamble on your life)
- As stoics, we shouldn't boast or try to flatter someone. (except for potential partners maybe?)
- Excellence withers wihtout adversity. You need it if you want to reach tranquility.
- The Stoic gods have a mischievous sense of humor. Instead of casuing your phone to stop working, they put it in a lemonade because that is more fun.
- The gods who administer the stoic test don't grade them, you have to do it yourself. 
	- Actions. Ask things like: before commiting to a action did you consider your options? Did you engage in lateral thinking? Was your workaround optimal?
	- Internals. Were you calm? That's a B. To get A, you need to enjoy that you're getting a chance to test out / demo your capabilities. Smile at the Stoic gods. Humor yourself.

- 5 second rule:
	- If we encounter a setback, we have 5-seconds to declare this as a Stoic test. This can help not the emotional response of anger be triggered. 
- What is unpleasant for most people can turn into fun for us.





Example: 
- Person X not treating me with the respect I deserve. He's not seeing the value I'm adding to his life. That's okay, this is what the Stoic gods have bestowed upon you. Don't give unsolicited advice to that person in future. He's not impressed, that's maybe because what you say aren't as insightful "to him" as much as you think they are.  
Grading my setback:
- Behaviourally, I did a decent job. Fixed my mistakes in a decent way. That's a B. It's kinda like I defended by honor. The Stoics wouldn't start with creating a model of themselves that force sthem to have their gaurd up which is what I did.
- I
