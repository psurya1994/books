## The Beautiful Cure

### Chapter 1:
- The area of immunology is complicated, and there's no lone wolf or a problem that's solved overnight. Many things should align well (including luck) for your ideas to take off.
- The immune system is much more complicated than what most people imagined. It has several layers of defences, and has the ability to detect specific germs and trigger appropriate immune responses.
- Studying in smaller animals (specifically fruit flies) was incredibly important to make critical discoveries in immunology. 

### Chapter 2:
- It's easier to spot something new if we're not looking for anything in particular. And have the "aw, that's interesting, I wonder why that happens" (in ML, this is how feedback alignment, bias-variance tradeoff in NN, etc., were discovered). Instead of running more directed experiments.
	- It's crazy that we are almost never actively encouraged to do this in academia. 
- innate immune response (general detection of germs) + adaptive immune response (fine tuned attack on these germs)
