- 27k for choloclates is flaunted amid 1000s of homeless people in NYC. US: obsessively consumer society, trying to have more at the compromise of oppressed. 

- PF didn't like libertarian drama. Didn't like academics / educators who hide their consumerism but criticize the public policies that lead to it. They betray the value they advocate for, and don't have a genuine dialouge with the oppressed. They change words to mean the opposite of oppresion (use euphemisms).use "diadvantaged" instead of "oppressed" to hide reality. 

- Neoliberal attitudes in brazil, increased corruption, led to hunger and deaths of lots of people. 

- Terrorism of the US: kills millions of people in afganistan, iraq, etc., while advocating equality inside the country. University profs write grant proposals to study Haiti slums and write papers, while letting 1000s of Haiti's remain in the slums. 

- 400mil dollars collected for haiti, and they constructed a 5-star hotel using a million dollars!
