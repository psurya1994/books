## How to be a Stoic

### General principles

- Stoicism is a rational, science-friendly philosophy that includes a spiritual dimension (connection with god) which is practical and open to revision.

- What does it mean to be a Stoic?
	- Not supressing emotions, but recognizing them, reflecting on what causes them, and redirecting them for our own good.
	- To keep in mind what is in our control and what's not; and focus on the former. So health, education and wealth are considered "preferred indifferents".
	- To pursue virtue (to live what god intended for you)
	- Practice a combination of reflecting on texts and engaging in various exercises.
	- Use the Stoic principles as only guidelines, and change them according to what's best for your situation.

- Stoicism has had influence on any many famous psychotherapies. Viktor Frankl's logotherapy, Albert Ellis's rational emotive behavior therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. Note: Stoicism is more than a therapy (short term approach to help people overcome specific problems), it's a philosophy of life.

- Stoic disciplines:
	- Discipline of desire tells us what is and what is not proper to want.
	- Discipline of action tells us how to behave in the world (external)
	- Discipline of assent tells us how to react to situations (internal) which emotions should we give assent to?

### Discipline of desire

- Look into the reality of lives with courage. Have a laser like focus on what you can control and blur out all other details. At the very least, this has to be your default mode (it is okay to slip occasionally into desiring other things, but you need to do it less and less over time). Here are two examples of how that'd look like:
	- "Your trial is on Senate" "Good luck to it, but this is the fifth hour, let us exercise" (the hour for the man's exercise and bath) "Your are condemned" "Exile or death?" "Exile" "And my property?" "Not confiscated." "Well then let us go there and dine"
	- PCTP knew of his death sentence while dining with friends. He clamly exccused himself, retired to his bedroom and slit his veins. He awaited death while conversing with his friend about the nature or soul.

### My thoguhts while reading:

- We're so addicted to our devices now that even going and re-living our childhoods would be incredibly boring. You don't have a computer or the internet, you're only watching the two interesting TV channels which run programs only for a couple of hours. What do you do with the rest of your time? (ask mom how I was spending time in my childhood)

- Imagine what you'd be when your iPhone break, you spill water on your computer, riots in your city or lose a leg in an accident. How would your priorities change then (on what's important in life)? And why not make those things you priorties now?
