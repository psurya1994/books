## Transcend:

### Overview

- This books presents a vision of the good life deeply grouded from the evidence in humanistic / positive psychology. The author uses a "sail boat" metaphor to argue on how we can maximize human well-being. This is covered in terms of what are human needs and how can we satisfy them.

- The sail boat:
	- security (boat): safety, connection, self-esteem
	- growth (sail): exploration, love, purpose
	- transcendence (sky) 

- Sources of well-being: more positive emotions, fewer negative emotions, satisfaction, health, control over environment, positive relationships, self-acceptance, mastery, autonomy, growth, engagement, purpose, trancedental experiences. The author presents all of these in his sail boat metaphor so that it will be easier to think clearly. 

- For well-being, we need to have the right balance between all of these sources (the process is generally slow, but that's okay). We can see all of these sources as "needs" that humans want to satisfy. Note: it is inevitable that some of these work in opposition to each other; for example, negative emotions are often inevitable in the process of growth. 

- If some needs are deprived, the preference for some sources might be much higher than others. (eg. a hungry man doesn't care about purpose or growth, he only wants to quench his hunger whichever way possible)

- One point that the author keeps coming back to repeatedly is "deficiency needs" (needs motivated by lack of satisfaction) and "growth needs"(needs motivated by by themselves). B-needs helps us transcend but D-needs need to be satisfied first. B-needs give deeper meaning to life. 

### Safety

- There are a huge number of people who live under poverty line, people who don't have basic housing and health care need; despite the top 1% growing richer. (this is an unacceptable reality of the world we live in)

- Self-actualization can only be built on a strong foundation of safety and security. The fundamental needs have to be met to give them an opportunity to realize their full potential. 

- Safety allows people to take risks and explore new ideas. In it's absence, people behave in predictable ways and become overly dependent on: protection, love, affection and esteem of others, which can compromise growth, development and meaning in life.

#### Psychological entropy

- Psychological entropy is the brain state with high chaos and unpredictability. In this state, people experience anxiety and distress. They set of a cascade of harmones (including cartisol) to prepare you to take action. 

- Examples: fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of losing control, fear of losing reputation, fear of losing emotional connection, etc. Events: what will the results of my blood test be? will I score well on my exam tomorrow? am I going to lose the court case? will I get food for my children today?

- People with high levels of neuroticism are particularly aversive to this state. These people have a stronger emotion response (as measured from the brain) to uncertain compare to negative feedback. (they prefer the devil they know over the devil they don't). 

- Neuroticism and mental health are strongly connected that some researchers argue that neuroticism is the core of all forms of psychopathology. Persistent fear and anxiety have serious consequences on learning, behavior and health (they alter brain connections). Behaviors: losing trust in others, regard people with suspicion, involve in gangs and organized crime.

- You cannot perform at full capacity to solve a mathematical proof when there's too much psychological entropy. The more uncertainity we face, the more metabolic resources our brain uses and the more stress we experience. 

#### Feeling hungry

- "A good way to obsure higher motivations is to make someone extremely and chronically hungry or thirsty." - Maslow 

- Food uncertainty leads to increased impulsivity, hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, aggression and propensity to use narcotics. It increases motivation to work or pay for food but decreases motivation to work or pay for any kind of non-food reward. 

#### Need for attachment security

- Attachment in relationships can characterized across two dimensions (they have weak correlation): (i) anxious: how concerned are you that you will be rejected / abandoned, (ii) avoidant: how to repond to stress-- do you use others as a secure base, or do you pull away from them. These are partially developed as we build mental models of others when we were kids.

- The way you're attached has important implications. Those who score low on both (secure) have more constructive ways of coping as opposed to insecure attachments.

- Insecurely attached relationships tend towards anxiety, loneliness, neuroticism, etc. They make choices distructive to relationships more often. They explain events in more negative ways. They report more emotional distress in situations when the partners "didn't respond when cuddling" or "wanted to spend the evening alone". Insecurely attached individuals perform better when they have a warm concerned partner. 

- Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) shows increase in relationship satisfaction. It helps partners see relationship as a safe secure based in times of stress and adversity. Making attachment-related concerns explicit and discussing them with a sensitive, attentive partner can be immensely helpful.

- Avoidant individuals are activated when they are pressured to share personal emotions or be more emoitonally intimate. Anxious individuals are activated by stressful situations that threaten the stability / quality of the relationship.

- Training parents to be sensitive to child's need increases attachment security in children. Adequate security also allows curiosity and exploration instead of fear and anxiety.

#### Trauma on the brain

- Ensuring children have safe and secure environments not only helps the child, but also builds a just and sustainable society.

- Most parenting styles don't leave indelible marks on children, but persistent stressors have long-term effects on the kids. Example: They have a hard time with emotional bonding, associate a particular situation with fear, etc.

- These fear responses aren't automatically lost over time, we need to actively unlearn them. Learning hope, the idea that you can control and harness uncertainity in environment, can help too. 

- Research: volunteers walking around in a neighborhood with high levels of crime increases their paranoia and reduces social trust. So it's understandable that people who live in such situations suffer from it. We as a society need to figure out ways to enable safety and security for such neighborhoods. (we would likely act very similar if we were put in the same situations)

- Children who undergo stress learn skills that are relevant and help them survive in their ecological context. The education system needs to figure of a way to work with them.

- Research: Hope (when they think they can have an impact) helps children perform better.

### Connection

- Connection, the need to form and maintain a minimal number of positive, stable and intimate relationships, is a basic need. Two subneeds: (a) need to belong, (b) need for intimacy.

- 

### Love

- Someone who sees merit in all perspectives on the table is rare these days, be that person. Even though, it doesn't garauntee material success, it does lead to a high levels of well-being.
- Love is not a deficiency need. Even though you're loved, people still give more love to other people without expecting anything in return (b-needs). 
- Once we're beyond a certain level of love fulfillment (d-love), we are capable to turning love outwards (b-love). 
- Dark triad: gradiose narcisism (entitled self-importance), Machiavellianism (strategic exploitation ad deceit) and psychopathy (callousness, cynicism and impulsivity). Light triad: Kantianism (treating people as ends in themselves), Humanism (valuing each individual worth), faith in humanity (believing humans are good). (B-love basically)
- B-loving people score high on agency (self-compassion, setting boundaries) and communion (non contractutal cooperation); both of which strongly correlated to well being
- You need to give unconditional love to people as long as it doesn't affect you notably. Giving love to other people is generally a nice experience, make the most of it! 
- Tips to avoid empathy burnout: anticipate that it will happen, supress it until appropriate time, humor, altrusim, expression aggression through activitues like sports.
- Have a quite ego: don't be defensive, don't have your gaurd on / try to protect your image. Balance all perspectives. 
- Whole Love: maintain strong individuality, yet maintain complete love experience. Maintain friendships, interests and activities ourside the romantic relationship. Extreme closeness without clinging onto each other. Avoid anxiously attached individuals who want to merge completely with the other person. Helps each other grow on their own goals. have a renewed sense of awe for your partner (through doing mutual activities together).    
- B-sex (in secure relationships) can also be a great source of meaning in one's life. 

- Cognitive empathy (theory of mind style understanding). Affective empathy (feeling other's emotional pain). Having both seems important? Unlike what Paul Bloom argues for (he says we should only have cognitive empathy)


### My thoguhts

I agree that having a copy of myself as a partner will get boring, but I do want her to share most of the values that are important for me like the following:
- Having strong indiviuality, yet completely invested our relationship.
- Has her own goals that she passionately pursues outside of our relationship. 
- Have atleast a few activities we can do together. (someone who's open to trying new things and learning new skills)
- Being secure about the relationship. We should continue maintain friendships, interests and activities outside the romantic relationship.
- Be able to similarly on important issues. (Eg. recognizing that materialism / wealth doesn't generally make people happier, etc.,)
- Be able to talk honestly about problems and work through them. Understanding that relationships are about accomodating each other, and that ideal romantic love is a sham.

- "self-actualization" -- . (the author doesn't clarify this definition early enough in the books that makes things harder for the reader)
