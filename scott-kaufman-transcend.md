## Transcend:

Introduction
- This books presents a vision of the good life deeply grouded from the evidence in humanistic psychology. The author uses many studies on what maximizes human well-being to create a "sail boat" metaphor that helps think more clearly about human needs and how to satisfy them.
- "self-actualization" -- . (the author doesn't clarify this definition early enough in the books that makes things harder for the reader)
- Sources of well-being: more positive emotions, fewer negative emotions, satisfaction, health, control over environment, positive relationships, self-acceptance, mastery, autonomy, growth, engagement, purpose, trancedental experiences. The author presents all of these in his sail boat metaphor so that it will be easier to think clearly. 
- For well-being, we need to have the right balance between all of these sources (the process is generally slow, but that's okay). We can see all of these sources as "needs" that humans want to satisfy. Note: it is inevitable that some of these work in opposition to each other; for example, negative emotions are often inevitable in the process of growth. 
- If some needs are deprived, the preference for some sources might be much higher than others. (eg. a hungry man doesn't care about purpose or growth, he only wants to quench his hunger whichever way possible)
- "Deficiency needs" -- needs motivated by lack of satisfaction. "Growth needs" -- needs motivated by wanting to grow. B-needs helps us transcend but D-needs need to be satisfied first. B-needs give deeper meaning to life. 
- security (boat) -- safety, connection, self-esteem. growth (sail) -- exploration, love, purpose. transcendence (sky)
