Ch1
- A digital detox wasn't enough to keep Nir from being distracted. He continued to stay distracted in the detox period too. This book takes a deeper look at why we're distracted and how things can be made better.

Ch2
- two types of distractions: internal (feeling hungry, fatigued, sick, bored, etc.,), external (notifications, people talking to you).

Ch3
- Chance's story of how a gamified pedometer made her exercise so much that it was taking a mental toll. The app knows how many points to offer chance to make her walk. The app was controlling her. She had other stresses in life at the same time, so the app was also an escape from reality. (example of uncomfortable internal trigger) 
- Understand what's that internal trigger you have that's causing you to be distracted.
- Anything that distracts / stops discomfort is potentially addictive. 

Ch4
- Distraction is an escape from pain. And life will always have pain / discontent.
- Four psychological factors that make satisfaction temporary:
	- Boredom is unsatisfying. The mind does not like to be alone. Study: 67% of men and 25% of females shock themselves when left long with their minds. In my case, I visit social media and cricket news websites to escape boredom. 
	- Negativity bias. We recall bad experiences more than good experiences.
	- Thinking in loops / rumination.
	- Hedonic adaptation
- We must learn to deal with discomfort without being distracted

Ch5
- Telling smokers (to remember) not to smoke is bad strategy. Studies show that this only makes it more likely. Better way: give them tools to handle the urge better (through midfulness).

Ch6
- Strategies to understand your internal triggers:
	- Recognize. Each time you're distracted, note the internal triggers leading up to it. 
	- Note. Write it down in detail "asap after recognizing": how you felt internally, time of the day
	- Explore. Stay curious with the feeling before acting on it. 
	- Awareness. Be aware each time you go overboard with a distraction. 
- Use the 5-minute rule: wait for 5 mins before giving in to the distraction. notice the senstations during this time. paying attention makes them dissipate. 

Ch7
- When doing difficult tasks, reframe hard work as fun. Don't give yourself prizes at the end, instead pay close attention, find challenges and gamify it.
