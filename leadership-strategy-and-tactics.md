Foundations
- Deatch
	- detaching yourself from the immediate problem helps you see things clearly. think about the bigger picture. 
	- be aware, don't get tunnel vision. be wary of what's happening in your body. 
- Arrogance and humility
	- people with inexperience generally try to hide behind their big ego; without listening to others.
	- listen to people's problems carefully. do your best to resolve them. 
	- "I'm looking forward to work with all of you." Be one of your subordinates.
	-  ask your subordinates to come up with plans. give them responsibility. quickly assess ideas, and point out problems. this makes your team more committed. 
	- take out the trash, do the dirty work. show humility.
- Overstepping bounds
	- support the boss, stay inside your bounds. be ready to lead, but also first be respectful to the boss and follow.
- Laws of combat and principles of leadership
	- Cover and move
	- Simple
	- Prioritize and execute
	- Decentralized command
- The power of relationships
	- Before trying to convince the boss of doing things differently, check for hte following: do you have a biased perspective because it's your idea? does making this change lead to notable difference in outcomes? how will this affect your relationship with your boss?
	- Complete the tasks that your boss offers on time, with as little resources as possible. Be the executors of solutions boss comes up with. Over time, your boss will see that you're the person who can make things happen. 
	- This makes the boss feel that when you raise an objection, it is on solid grounds.
	- What if the boss's plans are suboptimal, how do you convince your team? “Hey, team, I know there might be some better ways to skin this cat, but at this point, the effort to change the plan would take almost the same effort that it will to just get this job done. So we are just going to do it. And let me tell you what else we are doing by getting this done—we are building trust with the boss. Every one of these little tasks from him that we crush allows him to trust us more and more, and that gives us the ability to get listened to. So when something comes up that really doesn’t make sense, he will listen. That is why we are going to execute this plan to the absolute best of our ability.”
- Play the game
	- Play the long game. Build relationships in the long time. 
	- Listen and say yes as often as possible. So when you come up with a conflicting opinion, they listen to you.
	- Hey boss, I want to understand what you're suggesting better, so that I can fully support your plan.
- When is mutiny in order?
	- This is the last resort.
	- Try to listen what the boss is saying fully. Let him know the problem. Get his thoughts. Do this before mutiny. 
	- Never offend the boss, while trying to get a better understanding. 
	- "I want to understand your thinking, so that I can learn from it."
	- Give boss the full responsibility over the plan, say "I was thinking about one comments you made, which made me think we could ..."
- Born or made?
	- Both. 
- Leadership and manipulation
	- Focus on supporting the team, than seeking glory.
- Subordinate your ego
	- Humble yourself when it's a battle of an ego. Subdue your ego. That's the ultimate sign of competence. 
- Leader tell the truth.
	- Always tell the truth to the people. Tell truth with sensitivity. 
	- Continue sharing details consistently. DOn't wait to tell the truth. 
- Study.
	- Keep studying about leadership, see what top leaders do. Think about things from this lens.
	- Be able to predict team behavior. 

Core tenets
- Be capable and ask for help. Ask to learn from your subordinates when you don't understand specific tasks. Subordinates do not like leader who pretends to know everything. But be minimally aware / learn about it before asking for help.
- Ways to build trust:
	- Honesty
	- Trust your subordinates to do the job, take a decision, etc. If they make a mistake, teach them instead of demeaning them. Let them make mistakes and learn.
	- Tell the truth to your superiors, but do not complain. 
- Ways to build influence and respect:
	- Give respect and influence. Let them have influence over you.
	- Take ownership of all mistakes. 
	- Do the dirty menial work, when it's taxing on the troops.
- When no one's ready to take action, lead from the front. When there are people taking action, lead from the back and ensure they're prioritizing things correctly. Let the team members come up with the team, but if the team is unsure, then make the final call. Let your team lead. 
- Always be level-headed. Allow the sitatuion to unfold before saying your piece. 
- Be professional, don't reveal all your card as a leader. 
- Tell each member of the team, "you're the most important person in the team because if you don't do your job well, [this] is what's gonna happen, and that's disastrous for the team."
