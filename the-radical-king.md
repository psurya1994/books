The Radical King

Chapter 6:
- Argues for the importance of working together to eradicate the three evils of poverty, racism and militarism. For the whole world. 
- Rich countries must help the poor. Rich people shouldn't ignore the poor. Everyone is interdependent, and we can become better by helping our brothers.
- It makes no sense to fight for power or land when we have enough resources for everyone. 
- We must figure out a way to switch the arms race to peace race. 
- Argues for minimum livable wage for everyone in the US.
- My thoughts:
	- MLK is right. All of this income inequality makes no sense. I think we did overcome racism to a big extent, and it can be eradicated by empowering the black community even further by providing them more education and opportunities. It clearly leads to a better world, this is something Bernie Sanders vouches for, but the more practical Obama aruges that we should instead take smaller steps in that direction.

Chapter 8:
- MLK actively condemns a black person who makes anti-Semitic remarks. 

Chapter 12: 
- Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
- Non-violent campaign has four basic steps: determine if injustice exists, negotiate, self-purification and direct action. You can't wait for ever in the negotiate phase, you can use non violence to put pressure on the negotiate place if they're taking too long.
- An incredibly impressive example of how to respond to someone who criticizes you for a thoughtful non violent push back against injustice.
