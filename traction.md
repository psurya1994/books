Introduction:
- The principles from this book will eliminate all of your business related frustrations. An org that runs seemlessly and scales up easily. All of this is based on practical experience. 
- This is a very simple system, that works for everyone. 

Chapter 1: overview
- Every system is made up of core components. Business is made of six things, fix these and everything else will fall in place.
	- #1: vision
		- being able to think clearly, and convey this to the team
		- your team doesn't know your vision well. if you ask your team, each will give you a different answer. you need to make sure they see your vision.
	- #2: people
		- we need to keep the right people in the right seats.
		- the system is this book helps you judge that
	- #3: data
		- pick a few metrics to focus on (a scorecard)
		- helps you identify if things are going down
	- #4: issues
		- obstacles you need to face to execute your vision.
		- your ability to solve issues determines your success. this book provides you a system to do that.
	- #5: process
		- it is important to have a clear process on the paper
		- document the way everything needs to be done
	- #6: traction 
		- defines a way of organizing / process to keep everything organized in the business

Chapter 2: beliefs you need
- Take a leap of faith and believe in the EOS process. You need to embrace the following:
	- build and maintain a true leadership team
	- ceiling is inevitables
	- you can run your business on only one OS
	- you must be open-minded and vulnerable
- as a founder, you need to focus on solving bigger recurring problems instead of sweeping them under the rug
- you need to have your gaurd down.

Chapter 3: the vision
- clarify your vision, put it on paper, and share it with the team
- you will be able to state your vision clearly by answering these 8 questions:
	- what are your core values? 
		- define them, take actions based on them, reward employees based on them, fire based on them, etc. 
		- "built to last" -- companies that have clear core values last longer
	- what is your core focus?
		- what should our company be laser-focused on? stick to it. helps you have clarity.
		- don't work on core ideas if they're unrelated to your core focus; if you chase two rabbits, you catch neither
		- you can make these decisions by answering: why does your org exist? what's is your niche? 
	- what is your 10 year target?
		- successful companies have BHAG (big hairly audacious goals)
		- the actions you need to take will become clear with that target.
	- what is your marketing strategy?
		- don't try to please everyone. don't customize to what each customer wants. only please your ideal customer.
		- be clear about the following: target market, three uniques, proven process, gaurantee
		- target market: you need to know the demographic, geographic and psychographic characterstics. when reaching out, only reach out to people who meet this criteria. this will give you a clear sales strategy
		- the three uniques: maybe competitors share 1, but noone should share all three uniques. don't apologize for anything, when you're meeting all needs of the ideal customer.
			- never tell something you can show them, show it visually
		- give your garauntee.
	- what is your 3 year picture?
		- this will help people see where you want to go, and support
		- it helps the 1 year planning process
	- what is your 1 year plan?
		- don't try to get everything done. take only 3 goals and target them. don't try to do too many things. 
		- what specific attainable, measurable goal. 
		- have quarterly review sessions.
	- what are your issues?
		- notice all the issues you may have, and write them on paper (you need to clearly recognize problems before you can solve them)
- share your vision with your company. generally only 1 in 5 employees see a direct connection between what they are doing and the company's vision. 
- you can let you people ask you questions about hte vision. be vulnerable. 
- some people might not share your vision, you can let them go
- you will have to tell the vision seven times, before they start hearing it.

Chapter 4: the people
- surround yourself with good people. 
- you need to have the right people at the right place.
	- right people: who share your companies core vision
	- right place: the demands of the role fit each of the employee's unique ability
- possible problems
	- right person in the wrong seat: less productive company
	- wrong person in the right seat: chips away at the vision of the company, and is contagious. 
- the people analyzer tool: tells if the person is right
- if someone doesn't fit, communicate this with them and give them an opportunity to change.
- you can figure out the right seat using the accountability chart.
- you need to have good sales / marketing, operations and finance. only one person is incharge of each of these things.
- we need a visionary and integrator of the information.
- When you  put someone it a position, they need GWC
	- Get it
	- Want it
	- Have the capacity to do it
- you need to delegate and elevate based on the org requirements

Chapter 5: the data component
- use number to track the health of the company, not from people's subjective feelings. 
- it will also give different teams in the org a number that they need to optimize for 
- anything that's measured and watched is improved
- use the scorecard to guide the strategy for organization
- get everyone a number to meet. 
	- helps ease communication
	- helps create accountability
	- helps encourage right people
	- creates clarity and commitment
	- create competition
	- produce results 
	- creates teamwork
	- you solve problems faster

Chapter 6: the issues
- EOS ensures that no one in the organization can hide without accountability.
- the better you're at solving problems, the better you succeed in life. procrasting / lack of deccision is the top factor for failure. 
- it is more important to make a decision, than postponing it
- create a list of issues and track them. 
- create an environment where sharing problems is encouraged
- clearly identify issue, and work on it. discussion needs to be from the veil of ignorance. have healthy conflict, and get the best solution come to light. this is what needs to be incentivised in the company.
- you can state your point only once in meetings
- do in 3 steps: identify, discuss, solve

Chapter 7: the process
- identify companies core processes, and make sure everyone in organization understands them, values them and follows them.
- you need to raise above the system, to see if things are  going by the process. it's hard to do it while you're grinding in the system.
- identify and document the core processes, so that it's easy for peopel to follow. 
- as long as you're unable to think clearly about the process, you will remain busy being busy.
- there's so much inefficiencies that you can cut off on
- the more systematic your core processes are, the better improvement you see in sales, productivity, efficiency.
- documenting your core processes:
	- identify your core process
		- HR process: how you hire, manage, retain, fire employees.
		- marketing process: best way you get your across
		- sales process: how you convert a prospect into a customer
		- operations process: how you manage things to deliver to customer on time
		- accounting process: how we track monies coming in and going out
		- customer-rention process
	- list all of them in one document, so that the management is on hte same page. this is a high leverage activity, doing this will make everything else easier: everyone will now speak the same language.
	- call each of the processes with the same name consistently across the organization
	- documeting core processes:
		- document the 20% of hte processes that give 80% returns. don't document everything. 
		- don't waste valuable time trying to document every small detail. 
		- the system should be able to run without you, which is why you get the processes out of your head and onto the paper.
	- package it and name it "the ABC company way", use it during training

Chapter 8: the traction component
- the ability to create accountability and discipline, and then executre, is the area of greatest weakness in most organizations.
- two disciples needed to get traction
	- everyone must set specific measurable priorities (rocks)
	- must meet better as an org (meeting pulse)
- rocks: the 3-7 most important priorities that must be done in the next 90 days. 
	- get with the leadership team to focus on these. you will feel less overwhelmed, and stay focused on the mission.
	- everyone in the team needs to have rocks. the fewer the better, 1-3 is the best for IC and 3-7 for leadership.
	- this is how you get the laser focus for the organization focused in one direction.
- meeting pulse:
	- for leadeship, meeting is what they would do most of hte time. it is possible to have productive meetings. 
- quarterly meetings
	- human tend to fall off track every 90 days, which is why it's important to have quarterly checkup meetings.
	- this is necessary to ensure that chaos doesn't reign.
	- meeting agenda for such meetings included in the book
- annual meetings
- weekly meetings

Chapter 9: Pulling it all together
- answer the organization checklist list atleast twice every year, make sure you're hitting 80%; that's good enough
- why it works? because it's based on human psychology
- focus on enjoying the journey, and not to attain a goal / milestone fast
- you just need to stay focused, in this distracted world
