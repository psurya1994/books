## A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

Introduction
- The author was a professor of philosophy who stumbled on stocism when writing a book on desire, and converted to it. 
- The book intends to help the reader apply Stoicicm as a philosophy of life. A philosophy for life specifies the (i) grand goal of life (goal that's at the pinnacle of your goals list) and (ii) strategy for attaining that goal. 
- Most universities today do not cover philosophies of life unfortunately; unlike in ancient Greek / Roman times. 

| School of thinking | Philosopher | Ideas  | Other  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:----------------|:---------------|
| Cynic school of philosophy | Antisthenes | Ascetic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Cyrenaic school | Aristippus | Hedonic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Epicurean school | | | |
| Skeptic school | | | |
| Stoic school | Zeno of Citium | | In between extremes of Cynic and Cyrenaic |

- Stoic philosophy attempts to lessen negative emoitions and maximize positive emotions.
- Deafult philosophy in people's life: spend time seeking affluence, social status and pleasure; this is at best an enhanced version of hedonic lifestyle. 
- Seneca talks about finding delight in "inner" joys so that it is robust to externalities. 
- "I discovered with unanimous agreement among thoughtful people that we are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our insatiability" "A wonderful way to tame our tendency to always want more is to persuade ourselves to want **things we already have**"
- What does being a Stoic entail?
	- Reconsider goals in living: pursuit of tranquility (more positive, less negative emoitions) and virtue (?)
	- Being a thoughtful observer of ourr own life: eg. identify sources of stress so that we can avoid them. spend time exploring sources of pleasure and their side effects. periods of self-reflection

History:
- Originated in Greek, spread to Roman and evolved in the process. Greek focused on virtue (assuming humans are rational) and didn't stress on traquility. Roman stressed on tranquility and virtue which made it more attractive.
- Completing schools of thought in anchinet Greece fought for students. That was one reason why the philosophies were quite practical, only the ones that were practical and relevant survived. Students who took up a school of philosophy tried everyday to live by those principles. (this kind of competition definitely sounds better than the publication culture we have in academia right now)
- Socrates was one of the first philosophers who changed the focus to living well. His pupils founded various schools of philosophy. 	
- Stoicism: "People show enjoy the good things like has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only ig they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, we should periodically interrupt out enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating loss of whatever we're enjoying"
- Arugment for stoicism (initial version)
	- Argues for virtue. (Virtue: To live according to live as we were designed to)
	- Humans differ from animals in their ability to reason. Hence, we're designed to be reasonable / rational.
	- Nature intended us to be social creatures, so we should: honor our parents, be aggreable to friends, be concerned with the interests of our countrymen.

- About the stoics:
	- Seneca
	- Musonius
	- Epictetus
	- Marcus Aurelius

Negative visualization
- Why think about bad things that could happen? (i) can help prevent them, (ii) can lessen their impact when they actually happen, (iii) can help you appretiate what you have better. The alternative is to assume that good things are eternal, and we'd likely be subject to considerable distress when these things are taken away from us. 
- Hedonic adaptation is a bitch. We intuitively feel the next promotion will make us eternally happier, but we ineveitably fallback to our baseline happiness in just a few days after getting promoted. 
- We're unhappy when we have an unfulfilled desire. When we fulfill it, we adapt to it's presence and create new desires which leave us unfulfuilled. 
- Solution: Stop hedonic adaptation, convince ourselve to want things we already hae through negative visualization.
- All we have is on loan from fortune, which can reclaim in without out permission or advance notice. 
	- We should love all of our dear ones, but with always remember that we can't keep them for ever or even for long. We should periodically reflect that this will happen. 
	- In the very act of kissing our child, silently reflect on the fact that she will die tomorrow. In the act of saying goodbye to a friend, reflect on the possibility that this might be our final parting. 
- "We should live as if this very moment was our last." But doesn't this mean we should indulge in hedonic pleasures, giving up on our plans for tomorrow? No, that's not what the stoic's had in mind. Their goal is not the change the activities but out state of mind; a state where you appretiate the present moment.

Things I'm pondering on:
- What is god's purpose for me?
- Is there evidence that people will similar personalities generally end up friends? (my experience biking to RecreoParc)
