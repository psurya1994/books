## A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

### Introduction

- The book intends to help the reader apply Stoicicm as a philosophy of life. A philosophy of life specifies the (i) grand goal of life (goal that's at the pinnacle of your goals list) and (ii) strategy for attaining that goal. The author was a professor of philosophy who stumbled on stocism when writing a book on desire, and converted to it.

- What is Stoicism? It is a school of thought / philosophy of life which originated in ancient Greek which proposes practices and ways of thinking to live a good life. Practices include negative visualization.

- What does being a Stoic entail?
	- Reconsider goals in living: pursuit of tranquility (more positive, less negative emoitions) and virtue (to live according to what humans were designed for)
	- Living according to those goals using strategies suggested by the Stoics. Being a thoughtful observer of our own life. eg. identify sources of stress so that we can avoid them. spend time exploring sources of pleasure and their side effects. periods of self-reflection.

- Most universities today do not cover philosophies of life unfortunately; unlike in ancient Greek / Roman times. Default philosophy in people's life: spend time seeking affluence, social status and pleasure; this is at best an enhanced version of hedonic lifestyle. 

- Overcoming hedonic lifestyle is the key. Quotes from book: "I discovered with unanimous agreement among thoughtful people that we are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our insatiability" "A wonderful way to tame our tendency to always want more is to persuade ourselves to want **things we already have**""

### History:

- Socrates was one of the first philosophers who changed the focus to living well. His pupils founded various schools of philosophy.

| School of thinking | Founder | Ideas  | Other  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:----------------|:---------------|
| Cynic school of philosophy | Antisthenes | Ascetic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Cyrenaic school | Aristippus | Hedonic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Epicurean school | | | |
| Skeptic school | | | |
| Stoic school | Zeno of Citium | | In between extremes of Cynic and Cyrenaic |

- Stoicism originated in Greek, spread to Roman and evolved in the process. Greek focused on virtue (assuming humans are rational) and didn't stress on traquility. Romans stressed on tranquility and virtue which made it more attractive.

- Completing schools of thought in ancinet Greece fought for students. That was one reason why the philosophies were quite practical, only the ones that were practical and relevant survived. Students who took up a school of philosophy tried everyday to live by those principles. (this kind of competition definitely sounds better than the publication culture we have in academia right now)
 
- Stoicism is between the extremes of hedonisim and asceticism: "We can enjoy the good things like has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, we should periodically interrupt out enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating loss of whatever we're enjoying"

- The logic of Stoicism (initial version)
	- Argues for virtue. Humans differ from animals in their ability to reason. Hence, we're designed to be reasonable / rational.
	- Nature intended us to be social creatures, so we should: honor our parents, be aggreable to friends, be concerned with the interests of our countrymen.

- Popular stoics:
	- Seneca
	- Musonius
	- Epictetus
	- Marcus Aurelius

### Negative visualization

- Why think about bad things that could happen? (i) can help prevent them, (ii) can lessen their impact when they actually happen, (iii) can help you appretiate what you have better. The alternative is to assume that good things are eternal, and we'd likely be subject to considerable distress when these things are taken away from us.

- Hedonic adaptation is a bitch. We intuitively feel the next promotion will make us eternally happier, but we inevitably fallback to our baseline happiness in just a few days after getting promoted. I have fallen prey to this idea several times in my own like. 

- We're unhappy when we have an unfulfilled desire. When we fulfill it, we adapt to it's presence and create new desires which leave us unfulfuilled. Solution: Stop hedonic adaptation, convince ourselve to want things we already hae through negative visualization.

- All we have is on loan from fortune, which can reclaim in without out permission or advance notice. 
	- We should love all of our dear ones, but with always remember that we can't keep them for ever or even for long. We should periodically reflect that this will happen. 
	- In the very act of kissing our child, silently reflect on the fact that she will die tomorrow. In the act of saying goodbye to a friend, reflect on the possibility that this might be our final parting. 

- On death -- "We should live as if this very moment was our last." But doesn't this mean we should indulge in hedonic pleasures, giving up on our plans for tomorrow? No, that's not what the stoic's had in mind. Their goal is not the change the activities but our state of mind; a state where you appretiate the present moment.

- On loss of posessions
	- How would we feel about losing house, car, clothing, pers and bank balance? How would we feel if we lost our abilities to speak, hear, walk, breathe and swallow?
	- We are living the dream that we once had for ourselves. The ghost of hedonic adaptation is stopping us from feeling satisfied. So we need to change where we derive our happiness from. So, persuade yourself to want the things you already have!
	- We spend a lot of time thinking about what we don't have. We'd be much better off if we spend time on reflecting how much we would miss our things if they were not ours. - Marcus 
	- Attention is all that matters. Focus your attention on what's good to trigger positive emotions. Focus on what you don't have to trigger negative emotions. 

- FAQs
	- Wouldn't contemplating worst-case scenarios turn you into a pessimist? No, it gives you a better appretiation for life. For the half-filled glass example, a stoic expresses delight that the glass has not been stolen and the miracle of a material like glass. 
	- Is it foolish to be filled with joy about small things in life? No, what's foolish is to spend your life being dissatisfied when you could be satisfied by just changing your mental outlook. Does this satisfaction stop you from wanting more? No, part of being a stoic is also to stick to your morals and values; chasing virtue. You can both be content and be chasing virtue at the same time. (check)
	- How can you pursue tranquility and engage in negative visualization at the same time? The question carries an assumption that negative visualization triggers negative emotions. This need not be the case, Stoics contempate bad scenarios without worrying about them.
	- Doesn't negative visualization stop you from enjoying a picnic? We do it once in a while, not always. Only Stocis can truly enjoy the picnic because they understand it could taken away from them anytime. 

- View things from the veil of ignorance when judging bad things that happen to you. (also referred to as projective visualization)

- Be careful not to be overly attached to the things you already have, you could lose them anytime. Negative visualization teaches use to extract every bit of delight from the smallest things around us. Even if you lose some things, you could be able to attend to things that you have and be joyful about them.

- Everything happens for a last time. And you often don't know when the last time is. See anything you do as if it could be the last time you do it, and enjoy it as much as you can extracting every bit of delight.

### The Dichotomy of Control

- Only have goals that are completely in your control. Don't desire anything that is outside your control. (internal goals)
- It's okay to have external ideals to set your internal goals / values, but most of your focus should be on your internal goals. Use external goals only as far as you're deciding your internal goals / values. See the external ideal as your duty, what you're been put here to do.
- It's especially important to internalize our goals if failure is commonplace. (Action: Set internal goals for myself)
- Don't worry about things you can't control -- it's easy for you to say but how do I really do it? What we pay attention is in our control, and you can get better at it over time (meditation helps here). Use this skill to not spending any time thinking / worrying about things you can't control. 


### Fatalism


---

Things I'm pondering on:
- What is god's purpose for me?
- Is there evidence that people will similar personalities generally end up friends? (my experience biking to RecreoParc)
- Competition can lead to better results. Stoicism if one example. It might not have come up if it were not for the competition. 

---
Deleted points:
- Seneca talks about finding delight in "inner" joys as it is robust to externalities. 
- Nothing is worth doing pointlessly.
- We should trigger the emotion of joy on the things we already have, however small or trivial by considering a life without it.
