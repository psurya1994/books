## A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

### Introduction

- The book intends to help the reader apply Stoicicm as a philosophy of life. A philosophy of life specifies the (i) grand goal of life (goal that's at the pinnacle of your goals list) and (ii) strategy for attaining that goal. The author was a professor of philosophy who stumbled on stocism when writing a book on desire, and converted to it.

- What is Stoicism? It is a school of thought / philosophy of life which originated in ancient Greek which proposes practices and ways of thinking to live a good life. Practices include negative visualization.

- What does being a Stoic entail?
	- Reconsider goals in living: pursuit of tranquility (more positive, less negative emoitions) and virtue (to live according to what humans were designed for)
	- Living according to those goals using strategies suggested by the Stoics. Being a thoughtful observer of our own life. eg. identify sources of stress so that we can avoid them. spend time exploring sources of pleasure and their side effects. periods of self-reflection.

- Most universities today do not cover philosophies of life unfortunately; unlike in ancient Greek / Roman times. Default philosophy in people's life: spend time seeking affluence, social status and pleasure; this is at best an enhanced version of hedonic lifestyle. 

- Overcoming hedonic lifestyle is the key. Quotes from book: "I discovered with unanimous agreement among thoughtful people that we are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our insatiability" "A wonderful way to tame our tendency to always want more is to persuade ourselves to want **things we already have**""

### History

- Socrates was one of the first philosophers who changed the focus to living well. His pupils founded various schools of philosophy.

| School of thinking | Founder | Ideas  | Other  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:----------------|:---------------|
| Cynic school of philosophy | Antisthenes | Ascetic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Cyrenaic school | Aristippus | Hedonic lifestyle | Student of Socrates  |
| Epicurean school | | | |
| Skeptic school | | | |
| Stoic school | Zeno of Citium | | In between extremes of Cynic and Cyrenaic |

- Stoicism originated in Greek, spread to Roman and evolved in the process. Greek focused on virtue (assuming humans are rational) and didn't stress on traquility. Romans stressed on tranquility and virtue which made it more attractive.

- Completing schools of thought in ancinet Greece fought for students. That was one reason why the philosophies were quite practical, only the ones that were practical and relevant survived. Students who took up a school of philosophy tried everyday to live by those principles. (this kind of competition definitely sounds better than the publication culture we have in academia right now)
 
- Stoicism is between the extremes of hedonisim and asceticism: "We can enjoy the good things like has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, we should periodically interrupt out enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating loss of whatever we're enjoying"

- The logic of Stoicism (initial version)
	- Argues for virtue. Humans differ from animals in their ability to reason. Hence, we're designed to be reasonable / rational.
	- Nature intended us to be social creatures, so we should: honor our parents, be aggreable to friends, be concerned with the interests of our countrymen.

- Popular stoics:
	- Seneca
	- Musonius
	- Epictetus
	- Marcus Aurelius

### Negative visualization

- Why think about bad things that could happen? (i) can help prevent them, (ii) can lessen their impact when they actually happen, (iii) can help you appretiate what you have better. The alternative is to assume that good things are eternal, and we'd likely be subject to considerable distress when these things are taken away from us.

- Hedonic adaptation is a bitch. We intuitively feel the next promotion will make us eternally happier, but we inevitably fallback to our baseline happiness in just a few days after getting promoted. I have fallen prey to this idea several times in my own life. 

- We're unhappy when we have an unfulfilled desire. When we fulfill it, we adapt to it's presence and create new desires which leave us unfulfuilled. Solution: Stop hedonic adaptation, desire things we already have (using negative visualization).

- All we have is on loan from fortune, which can be reclaimed in without out permission or advance notice. Here are somethings we could potentially reflect on:
	- We should love all of our dear ones, but with always remember that we can't keep them for ever or even for long. We should periodically reflect that this will happen. 
	- In the very act of kissing our child, silently reflect on the fact that she will die tomorrow. In the act of saying goodbye to a friend, reflect on the possibility that this might be our final parting. 
	- How would we feel if one of these things happen? Losing one of your leg in an accident, spilling water on your laptop, getting fired your job, being publicly shamed on the internet, losing your reputation globally, breaking the screen of your new phone, your bank account being ceased, being jailed for a crime you did not commit, etc.,
	- How would we feel if we lost our abilities to speak, hear, walk, breathe and swallow?

- On desiring things we already have
	- We are living the dream that we once had for ourselves.
	- We spend a lot of time thinking about what we don't have. We'd be much better off if we spend time on reflecting how much we would miss our things if they were not ours. - Marcus 
	- Attention is all that matters. Focus your attention on what's good to trigger positive emotions. Focus on what you don't have to trigger negative emotions. 

- On death -- "We should live as if this very moment was our last." But doesn't this mean we should indulge in hedonic pleasures, giving up on our plans for tomorrow? No, that's not what the stoic's had in mind. Their goal is not the change the activities but our state of mind; a state where you appretiate the present moment.

- FAQs
	- Wouldn't contemplating worst-case scenarios turn you into a pessimist? No, it gives you a better appretiation for life. For the half-filled glass example, a stoic expresses delight that the glass has not been stolen and the miracle of a material like glass. 
	- Is it foolish to be filled with joy about small things in life? No, what's foolish is to spend your life being dissatisfied when you could be satisfied by just changing your mental outlook. Does this satisfaction stop you from wanting more? No, part of being a stoic is also to stick to your morals and values; chasing virtue. You can both be content and be chasing virtue at the same time. (check)
	- How can you pursue tranquility and engage in negative visualization at the same time? The question carries an assumption that negative visualization triggers negative emotions. This need not be the case, Stoics contempate bad scenarios without worrying about them. Even if it does trigger some negative emotions / stress, it's compesated when you come back into the moment with a feeling of deep gratitude for living the life of dreams.
	- Doesn't negative visualization stop you from enjoying a picnic? We do it once in a while, not always. Only Stocis can truly enjoy the picnic because they understand it could taken away from them anytime. 

- View things from the veil of ignorance when judging bad things that happen to you. (also referred to as projective visualization)

- Be careful not to be overly attached to the things you already have, you could lose them anytime. Negative visualization teaches use to extract every bit of delight from the smallest things around us. Even if you lose some things, you could be able to attend to things that you have and be joyful about them.

- Everything happens for a last time. And you often don't know when the last time is. See anything you do as if it could be the last time you do it, and enjoy it as much as you can extracting every bit of delight.

### The Dichotomy of Control

- What things are completely under our control? 
	- The goals we set, but not if the outcome.
	- The values we set. Be indifferent to anything that lacks value in your life.
	- Our character: sincerity, discipline, dignity, etc., 

- Only have goals that are completely in your control. Don't desire anything that is outside your control. Internalize your duties as a human being as your goals. You duty is to do the best you can on what nature offers you. 

- It's okay to have external ideals to anchor your internal goals / values, but most of your focus should be on your internal goals. Use external goals only as far as you're deciding your internal goals / values. See the external ideal as your duty, what you're been put here to do.  It's especially important to internalize our goals if failure is commonplace. 

- Don't worry about things you can't control -- it's easy for you to say but how do I really do it? What we pay attention is in our control, and you can get better at it over time (meditation helps here). Use this skill to not spending any time thinking / worrying about things you can't control. 

- FAQ: Why not stop growing and be content with what we already have? Our external goals would be much easier to achieve that way. Because that is not living virtuiously (inline  with what nature has designed us for), you need to do you duty diligently irrespective of how the external environment changes. That's doesn't distrub traquility, it adds to it. The feeling that you've given your best, despite all forces pushing back, is incredible.


### Fatalism

- Another frame of thinking: Our past has already been decided, we cannot change it. You (the self inside your head in this very moment) can't control your future actions, all you control is your immediate next action. That's all you need to focus on, one action at a time. 
- If you find yourself distracted, reset the clock. Recognize the situation. You're dealt with these cards, where the momentum from past is pushing you in the opposite direction of your duties. That's fine. Let that feeling sink in, and start taking actions to counter that momentum (go get water, have a bath, etc.,). 
- Every moment is disfortune is an opportunity to practice your Stoic skills. Without disfortune, you can't get better. If there's no disfortune in your life, include them in a controlled way so that you can practice these skills. The more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in war. 
- You're a small part of this big machine. It doesn't matter (to either others or nature) what you think or feel. It shouldn't to you either. All that matters is taking the right actions in this very moment.
- It's not okay to think about past for worrying (exception: death of a close person, you're allowed to grieve for sometime). Worry emerges from replaying "bad" (remember again, your judgement is what makes them bad) events from the past. It's fine, though, to ponder on the past to learn lessons that can guide you in future. 

### Self-denial

- Besides negative visualization, we need to live as if those things happened. Practice periodically: living with the scanitiest of resources, under dress for cold weather, walk shoeless, etc. This helps us that the worst case scenario is not really that bad. When "bad" things happen, we can recollect these experiences and realize that we've persisted through worse (similar to Goggins's cookie jar concept). 
- But remember, the goal is not to feel negative emotions and persist through them. The goal is not to feel them at all. This can actually be a source of immense pleasure, if you can connect to how you're fulfilling your duties by doing this. 
- Advantages: (i) acts as a vaccine: small does now make you robust to future suffering, (ii) reduces anxiety in the present moment and (iii) helps us appretiate what we already have. 
- The goal here is the expand your "comfort zone", range of experiences that you can be content with.
- Pleasures that can capture us in single exposure need to be avoided (for example, addictive drugs). 
- Practice self control by denying yourself some good things (avoid eating your favourite food at a dinner party). The alternative is to lack self control, which means we'll be hostage to the pleasures that life has to offer. The control should always be within us.
- With repeated practice, you will be able to do things others dread doing and refrain from doing others cannot resist. 

### Meditation
- Introspection is a key aspect of the Stoic practice. Ask things like: What have I failed resisting? What have I done well? What can I improve? Did I fulfill my duty today? Was I closer to tranquility today? Did I do anything that's pointless today (instead of fulfilling my duties)?
- Signs of progress: we see disfortunate as a way to practice Soticism, we will stop caring about our reputation, our impulses to distraction / binge eating will be reduced, etc.
- What matters most is not out ability to spout Stoic principles, but our ability to live in accordance to them. - Epictetus
- A novice Stoic would like to boast about giving up ice cream in favor of water, whereas an advanced Stoic wouldn't care to comment. 
- We should actively avoid giving it away that we're practicing Stoicism, that others don't even see it.
- Even if we practice Stoicism all our life, there will always be room for improvement. You don't need to become a Stoic sage overnight, it's fine as long as you're making adequate progress. - Seneca
- Am I challenging myself enough as a Stoic? Am I growing enough as a Stoic? If not, actively add more challenges to your life to become a better Stoic and increase your comfort zone of experiences. 

### On serving humanity
- We have a duty to form and maintain relationships with other people, despite the trouble they might cause us. 
- Making progress in life comes with challenging situations to practice our Stoicism. We envy people more successful than us, others envy our success. People we love have the power to break our hearts. But we still need to do them, and practice Stoicism to avoid negative emotions.
- Stoic will be oblivious on the services he offers for others (he doesn't care about reputation). He doesn't boast, he just moves onto his next service. 
- Marcus was motivated by his duty. Not fear of punishment. Not for credit. The duty was an end in itself (like Maslow's B-needs). 

- Avoid being friends with people with corrupted values as they might contaminate ours. We should remain true to who we are when we associate with other people. 
- We should seek friends who are better than us in their Stoic values, so that we can learn from them. 
- Avoid social meetings with non-Stoic value people (unless our duty requires us). Be silent when people complain, don't indulge. 
- A good Stoic will not think about what other people are thinking. - Marcus
- The biggest risk in dealing with annoying people is they will make us hate them. We should tell ourselves that they are destined to act that way. We need to work to make sure they don't destroy our charitable feelings towards them. - Marcus.

Things I'm pondering on:
- What is god's purpose for me?
- Is there evidence that people will similar personalities generally end up friends? (my experience biking to RecreoParc)
- Competition can lead to better results. Stoicism if one example. It might not have come up if it were not for the competition. 

---
Deleted points:
- Seneca talks about finding delight in "inner" joys as it is robust to externalities. 
- Nothing is worth doing pointlessly.
- We should trigger the emotion of joy on the things we already have, however small or trivial by considering a life without it.
