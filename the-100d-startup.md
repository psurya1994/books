Prologue:
- work on something you would do anyways (a hobby, skill or passion) -- and make it a business to get freedom and add value
- This book is a blueprint on how you can do that. 

Chapter 1
- once you get something started, things can scale very quickly. even though doing something for the first time is hard, scaling up currently doesn't take as much effort.
- to start a business, you need: a product, a group of people to pay for it, a way to get paid
- if you're good at one thing, you probably have many compliemntary skills. do things you're skilled at, passionate about, and what customers want.

Chapter 2
- bad idea: start a business, while being uncertain weather your idea will resonate with customers
- easy way: find out what people want and give it to them
- it doesn't matter how you do it, the customer doesn't need insights of how you do it, he just needs the output.
- we're not selling a product, we're selling an experience that impacts people's lives.
	- this is much more valuable, and directly gets at what we're offering hte client
- how to find projects for business:
	- inefficiencies in the marketplace (eg. long wait times, missing flights, etc.)
	- new technology or opportunity (eg. new ai models, demand for indian weddings, etc.)
	- changing space (eg. demand for something dropping -- that might be the right time for you to get it)
	- keep starting side projects / spin-offs
- value of things
	- always think about how your product is affecting people emotionally, that what people are really paying you for at the end of the day.
	- strategy 1: you need to understand what the customer wants, before they know it themselves (you will know this through experience, as you try new things with clients.)
	- strategy 2: make your customer a hero (if you use this product, you're gonna being much smarter and can navigate life very easily with everyone around admiring you)
	- strategy 3: sell what people buy (don't give them details they don't care about; package them properly so that it exactly meets their needs)
- what do people really want from a business?
	- more: love, money, acceptance, time
	- less: stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainity
	- if you're business is around helping people with their problems, you'll always have plenty of work
- give customers the fish, not the process of getting to the fish.
- to make it big, you just need to build things accoridng to these principles, and keep iterating.

Chapter 3
- connect what you love doing, to what other people want. that's how you make money
- how to become a consultant:
	- pick something specific as opposed to general
	- do not underprice your work. charge atleast 100$ an hour (for business consultants)
- use instant consultant biz template to get started with consulting.
- make sure you connect your passion to what peopel want. that's how you get paid.

Chapter 4: 
- ideas on becoming your own publisher. all you need is a good topic that people want to learn about; and a guide on how to get there.
	- eg. book "A Gentle Introduction to AI-based Art"

Chapter 5: 
- this chapter is about thinking clearly about customers
- group customers based on new demographics: interests, passions, skills, beliefs, values. 
- make sure your product delivers exactly what the client wants. 
- sell to full franchises, instead of one owner at a time. 
- so how do you build a good business?
	- 1: latch on to a popular hobby / passion or craze. For example, marriages in india, diet, exercise, accountability partners, etc. 
	- 2: sell what people buy

Chapter 6: The one-page business plan 
- build things that you want, and it might just end up being helpful for others too
- build something, put it out there, wait for customer response and fine tune accordingly.
- invest sweat and equity instead of money
- have an action bias, here's how you do it
	- #1: pick a markatable idea
		- focus on usefulness, not novelty
		- do market testing: see number of keyword searches for the product, focus on solving a pain, focus on different + better (don't rebuild something that's already there), talk to potential customers (who fits the persona) in your circle, give the build product to some people for testing
	- #2: get the first sale as soon as possible
		- focus on following these principles and building something (if it fails, it's great marketing content too)
	- #3: market before manufacturing
		- advertise something, see if people want it, then build it
- mission statement: we help (customers) do (primary benefit)

Chapter 7: An offer you can't refuse
- you need to present your product at the right time, with a pitch they cannot refuse
- offer you can't refuse = right time, right audience, right promise

Chapter 8: launch
- if you make people anticipate for your product, their interest goes up.


Chapter 9: hustling
- hustler: someone who does both talking and putting in the work

Chapter 10: the 100$ startup

- complete on the value, not the money
