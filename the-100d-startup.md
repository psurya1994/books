Prologue:
- work on something you would do anyways (a hobby, skill or passion) -- and make it a business to get freedom and add value
- This book is a blueprint on how you can do that. 

Chapter 1
- once you get something started, things can scale very quickly. even though doing something for the first time is hard, scaling up currently doesn't take as much effort.
- to start a business, you need: a product, a group of people to pay for it, a way to get paid
- if you're good at one thing, you probably have many compliemntary skills. do things you're skilled at, passionate about, and what customers want.

Chapter 2
- bad idea: start a business, while being uncertain weather your idea will resonate with customers
- easy way: find out what people want and give it to them
- it doesn't matter how you do it, the customer doesn't need insights of how you do it, he just needs the output.
- we're not selling a product, we're selling an experience that impacts people's lives.
	- this is much more valuable, and directly gets at what we're offering hte client
- how to find projects for business:
	- inefficiencies in the marketplace (eg. long wait times, missing flights, etc.)
	- new technology or opportunity (eg. new ai models, demand for indian weddings, etc.)
	- changing space (eg. demand for something dropping -- that might be the right time for you to get it)
	- keep starting side projects / spin-offs
- value of things
	- always think about how your product is affecting people emotionally, that what people are really paying you for at the end of the day.
	- strategy 1: you need to understand what the customer wants, before they know it themselves (you will know this through experience, as you try new things with clients.)
	- strategy 2: make your customer a hero (if you use this product, you're gonna being much smarter and can navigate life very easily with everyone around admiring you)
	- strategy 3: sell what people buy (don't give them details they don't care about; package them properly so that it exactly meets their needs)
- what do people really want from a business?
	- more: love, money, acceptance, time
	- less: stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainity
	- if you're business is around helping people with their problems, you'll always have plenty of work
- give customers the fish, not the process of getting to the fish.
- to make it big, you just need to build things accoridng to these principles, and keep iterating.

Chapter 3
- connect what you love doing, to what other people want. that's how you make money
- how to become a consultant:
	- pick something specific as opposed to general
	- do not underprice your work. charge atleast 100$ an hour (for business consultants)
- use instant consultant biz template to get started with consulting.
- make sure you connect your passion to what peopel want. that's how you get paid.
