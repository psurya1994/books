## A Slap in the Face: Why Insults Hurt

The book focuses on why we insult, why insults hurt, how can we make insults hurt us less, how can we deliver fewer insults, etc., The books helps think more clearly about the component of insults in life, and how we can change our behaviour to live a good life. 

Insults are ubiquitous. People take insults too seriously. It's hard to predict what counts as insult: it depends on culture, sensitivity, circumstances,  insecurity, etc., 

We often go out of our way, often subconsciously, to inflict insults that will put people in their place. 

Why do we insult? We are evolutionarily wired to play the social hierarchy game (showing others that you're smarter than them), and insults are a primary tool to help us acheive this goal. 

Playful teasing that we engage in helps us strengthen our relationships to others, but we need to be careful while doing it (as it can easily be mistaken to be an insult).

Insults by: omission, implication, 

Praise can sometimes be interpreted as insults. For example, (i) when you praise someone else, (ii) when you praise someone for something they're not proud of, (iii) when you praise someone less than they think of themselves as. (i) can be avoided by never, in public, declaring someone as "the best", only say "one of the best"

A good response to praise is self-depretiating humor. 
- "Congrats on winning the price money, you're gonna have a personal assistant answer your emails" "I wish, haha. I don't have plans of hiring a PA but I can now finally afford to get my door bell fixed."
- "I think you're really good at X, possibly the best" "Thank you."
- "Man you're being more and more successful, hopefully you'll continue to talk to me" "Haha, thanks, I hope to get to your level of doing Y someday. I'm awestruck by how easy and natural Y is for you."

People use playful praise to ensure that you're still part of their tribe and that success hasn't gotten to your head. Always respond humbly to them. Respond with self depretiating humor or playing along for playful teasing (who's the idiot who gave you this promotion).

Insults in public can multiply it's effects. 

Being upset that your partner forgot your birthday isn't good. People show love differently, and maybe she has a different way to express love. Maybe she's a forgetful person or going to considerable stress. 

People are more predisposed to feel insulted when in an insecure relationship.

There are two ways to minimize the harm causes by verbal insults. One, punish people who verbally insult others. Two, make people less sensitive to insults. The author argues for the importance of the later. The problem with focusing on the former is that insults are relative. We'll have to censor and punish everyone to minimize the harms insults cause. 





> go around and try collecting insults. when people try to insult you, work with them to make the insult stronger. -- this is a good experiment to run; helps you learn to handle insults better, helps you recognize how much you insult others

> what are the three words that best describe me, what kinds of insults on this image of myself would pain me the most?
"disciplined" "ML researcher" "routines expert" "non-fiction reader" ""

Insults hurt only when you're insecurely attached to an identity. 

What is my self-identity? What's the thing that people can say to me that I would find the most offensive? And what should my response be to such situations.

"You're my b...."
"I think you don't really stand by any of the commitments you make. All you do is show off. "
"I'm surprised you don't even know this."

Good response to insults:
"Let me assure you, it's worse than you suggest."
"If you're surprised by this, I bet there's a lot more you'd be surprised by."
"It is perfectly understandable that you'd say that. I'm a provocative person, and I bring that sort of thing out from people. Really, I'm to blame."
Post the event, "it really got heated in there, I'm sorry."

See insults as a good thing that can help practice the things I learnt here. 

Don't play the social hierarchy game. As long as you're not playing it, it should be easy for you to apologize, and let people tell others how smart they are and how dumb you are. Be proud for not playing that game.

You tend to put other people in "their place" in casual conversations. You imply that you're smarter than them, stop doing that. When someone tells you about their vacation, don't tell them about the ways in which yours was better. Just hear them out, and say "that sounds a lot of fun, I'd love to plan a similar vacation at some point. "

What about praise? It's okay to praise others to influence their behaviors. 

Don't self-promote yourself. Unless they are actively asking you for it, and you think it would actually help them become a better person. 

My rules for handling praise.
- Always say thanks when someone praises you.
- Try to add in some self-depretiating humor if you're close to the person.
