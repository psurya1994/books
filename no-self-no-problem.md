Summary:

The book suggests that the left brain is responsible for creating stories out of our experiences, where as the right brain experiences things as they are. It further suggests that most suffering is due to this illusory sense of self created by the left brain, and we can avoid suffering by finding a middle way between the left and right brain. You can access the state (that buddha refered to as the end of suffering) by quiteing the clutter by your left brain through the use of meditation, yoga, mindful movements, etc. The book underdelivers on the science, and at points becomes pseudoscientific by giving credence to anecdotes with supernatural phenomena.

Preface:
- Effects of meditating regularly on the brain
	- No reduction in cortex thickness with age
	- Have smaller amygdala
	- Larger temporoparietal junctions (associated with empathy and compassion)
- Similar effects have been observed for tai chi, yoga, etc.
- Latest science also supports the idea of "no self", the self we think exists is a fiction.

Introduction:
- Western philosophers see thinking as the core characterstic of being human (eg. I think therefore I am). The east often advocates the view that thinking is part of the problem (eg. Zen Bhuddism: "No thought, no problem").
- Concept of the self (this thinker inside our head making decisions) is a construct of the mind. The process of thinking creates it, rather than it being at a specific part of our brain. 
- Without thought, the self does not exist. Scientists are not able to pinpoint the location of self in the brain, possibly because it doesn't exist.
- Why does this matter? Because the illusory sense of self (or the attachment to self) is the primary cause of suffering in our life. 
- Why are we unhappy? Because everything we think and do is for ourselves, and there isn't one. - Wei Wu Wei
- Left brain: story maker, right brain: finding meaning, big ideas, etc.

Chapter 1:
- Research on split brain patients (people who's corpous collosum is severed) show that left brain creates stories (often false) to make sense of the experiences (while behavior could be fully driven by the right brain). Left brain also controls speech.
- If we're in a higher state of arousal, the left brain attributes that arsoual to a specific part of our experience. Eg. I'm aroused because that girl is pretty (while the reality is because you were tensed).
- The "I" makes a number of mistakes with interpreting the world, what if it is also wrong about the existence of itself?

Chapter 2: Langauge and categories

- The left brain uses the tools of langague and categories extensively. 
- Right brain can understand written and spoken word, it just doesn't control speech. Left brain creates and controls speech, including the internal self talk we have. 
- Thinking happens when the left brain is talking to itself.
- Left brain mistakes the map for reality. 
- "It's not things that upset us, but our interpretation of them" -- left brain is responsible for this interpretation. If we don't interpret, we wouldn't be upset. 
- Without langauge, we don't have a self. Helen Keller developed the sense of self only after learning language. 

- Left brain also categorizes things into concepts. Categories are mental representation that don't exist out there but only in the human mind. 
- Who are you? We generally respond with categories to that question (a father, a engineer, etc.), but those categories are not reality. "I" is also a useful categorization that isn't real. Taking it too serious makes us vulnerable to suffering.
- To think is to think categorically, there's no other way.
- Everyone is continually making their own interpretations and categorizations of the reality our there through their left brain.
- Being meta aware that your left brain's interpretation is what's leading you to suffering can help you disassociate with it. 
- When the left brain judges thinks are right or wrong or good or bad, we call them beliefs. In reality, no beliefs are true (it's just our brain making a shitty approximation). Everyone has their own point of view and none is more right than the other. The core reality is much more complicated. 

- Eastern philosophy: we are not our thoughts and beliefs. right and wrong are only sickness of the mind. 
- How to disassocaite from the left brain's conception of I? Recognizing it for what it is again and again. Each time we create stories and make judgments, repeatedly recognize that it's just the left brain making it up and not reality. 
- The left brain can be often tripped by paradoxical statements. Zen uses koans to trip our mind from thinking. "what is the sound of one hand clapping?" -- sounds silly for the interpretive mind but not the right brain.


Chapter 3: Pattern perception
- Identity is merely a pattern of events in time and space. Change the pattern and you have changed the person.-- Maharaj
- Left brain also instantly recognizes things as patterns (text, speech, etc.) and categorizes them. 
- Left brain sees patterns that are not there, and creates stories and interpretations out of them. 
- Left brain is driven by dopamine and right by seratonin. Too much dopamine leads to schizophrenia. Dopamine enhances pattern recognition capabilities of the brain.
- The left brain is in need for consistency and patterns. We have different selfs that change over time: the work self, the home self, the workout self, when we're angry, etc. We interpret it as a single unchanging self, but it's continually changing and evolving. 
- Exercise: count the different "you's" that you encounter.
	- When we say "I'm disappointed with myself", we mean that our present self is disappointed with the actions of our previous self. 
- Where is the self when no one is thinking about it? 

Chapter 4: Right brain
- By suffering a left brain stroke, a neuroanatomist, lost the feeling of self and entered a traquil state. 
- What if we turn off the left brain? Maybe the right brain is always having this blissful experience but we're unable to identify with it because of the clutter of the left brain. 
- We need left brain to get things done, solve problems in life, etc., We need to right brain to enter that bliss like state which is the end of suffering. 
- Yoga, meditation, flow can get you into the state of right brain consciousness.
- Right brain controls subconscious motor activities, left brain adds additional narrative around them. In a high pressure match, it's better to shut off the left brain and let the right brain do it's thing (if you've practiced well enough).
- In the reality of the right brain, there are no winners or losers, no teams or championships, there is just being and doing.
- When you just do something without thinking, it's the right brain acting. 

Chapter 5: meaning and understanding
- Right brain can have a panaremoic view od the world where as the left brain narrows in onto specific details. 

Chapter 6: Intuitions and creativity
- These are tools of the right brain. 
- A way out of suffering, ensure that you're interpretive mind don't try to control it's emotions.
- Gratitude and compassion are already a parts of us in the right brain.
- The initial gut feeling you have about something might be from your right brain that has a more holistic view of the situation.

Chapter 7: Consciousness
- Now, we're heading into the land of woo-woo. Makes huge unscientific claims without having the scientific backing. Each of these people with massive claims, if they existed, would have made a lot of money by demonstrating it at the James Randi challenge.
- This makes me question all the things that have been previous claimed in the book too. For now, I'll just go with these ideas that I find useful as cognitive tricks to live a better life, but not as truth.
- Eastern philosophy: you're consciousness is giving rise to the world.
- The book mistakes the ideas of body schema as to the existence of consciousness. 

Chapter 8: The Real You
- Take life lightly. Laugh. Smile. Be curious. Be grateful. Don't cling. Don't push.
