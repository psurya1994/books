Most small businesses are not started by entreprenuers, they are started by technicians. Often, they are working for someone, learn enough about the work, become the best technician at their work (and also enjoy doing the work), so they decide to start a business independently. 

They tend to continue to be technicians once they start their own business. They try to do everythign by themselves, all the admin + tech stuff. They start to realize that it's too much. They hire someone, who is also quite enthusiastic and helps them get things done. However, that person suddenly quits, leaving the company in doubt. So the person scales it back, and operates it alone. But he realizes that doing that doesn't give him the freedom that he wants from such a business. He dreads the work, and gives up on it. 

Why does this dynamic play out? It's because of the naive model of the person about the world of business. What does he not realize?

Being a small business owner is essentially switching between three roles: entreprenuer, manager and technician. A typical person who starts a business tries to be 70% technician, which is the cause of the problem. They need to keep higher focus on being an entreprenuer and manager. Focus on hiring and offloading stuff, instead of he himself taking up so many things.

Chapter 7: turn-key revolution
- McD was able to develop hamburger machines, so that human skill is not needed anymore. That's a game changer. If you can build your business in a way such that anyone can run, you make your life much easier. 
- Franchises are terminated <5% annually, compared to 80% failure rate of independent businesses. Business-format franchies (gives full system for the new franchies to build) are ground changing.
- McD built a systems-dependant business, so that anyone who uses those systems, things will work. Instead of people-dependant business. 
- Ray, the founder of McD, worked on it such that any idiot can run it with the rulebook. He thoughts like an engineer mass producing a enginer: what can go wrong and how can we avoid htat? 
- The consistency of McD is what makes it stand out. It's able to consistency produce things across so many franchises for 30 years, that a typical business owner fails to produce for an year. 
- McD is a great model that we can emulate. 

Chapter 8: the franchise prototype
- 75% of franchises succed in 5 years, 20% of standard small business succeed in 5 years. 
- How did McD acheieve that kind of consistnecy? Same same products, put through the same process for the exact same time. 
- Focus on building a business that's free of you. That's the best way to build a successful small business.

Chapter 9: working on your business, not in it
- your business is not your life. thr purpose of the business is to serve your life. 
- pretend that what you're building is a prototype for 5000 more just like it. understand that you have to provide consistent value to your customers; beyond what they expect.
- focus on building a system that can be operated by the lowest skilled workers. it shouldn't be dependent on one high skilled worker that you would hire.
- don't make a business that's dependent on the employees you hire. If you do, the productivity depends on the moods of people. this helps your resolve people problem.
- be systems oriented, focus on improving systems instead of improving the skills of people.  
- document all work that needs to be done in operations manuals
- it's important to procide predictable service to customer. 

Chapter 10: the business development process
- three foundations:
	- innovation (thinking of new ideas)
	- quantifications (quantifying the effects of these new ideas)
	- orchestration (create order based on above insights)
- use this to create a franchise (your unique way of doing business)

Chapter 11: your business development program
- happens in 7 steps covered in the following chapeters:
- #1: Your Primary Aim
	- You need to think more clearly: what do I actually want from my life? who do I wish to be?
	- It give you the purpose and energy to do whatever you want to.
- #2: Your Strategic Objective
	- Once you realize what's most important to you, then you can turn to see what kind of business will enable to get you there. 
	- It is a statement of what your business needs to do to achieve your primary aim. 
	- standard #1, money: think about how much money you need to live free of money constraints, and if the business can meet it
	- standard #2, opportunity worth pursuing: ask, does the business alleviate the frustration of lots? people buy feelings, not commodities. what craving of theirs will this product fulfill?
	- standard #3, clear plan
	- when you're selling, sell the fantasy of using the product  (how the person's life is going to be many times better), and not the features of hte product
- #3: your organization strategy
	- have a hierarchy, not structuring things clearly is too chaotic
	- even if you have a co-founder, you need to clearly split the tasks and be accountable for them.
	- think of yourself as shareholders of the company; and while working think of yourself as employees. you goal is to reaplce the employees with someone else once you can afford to.
	- create an organization chart (for each role in a few years time) and start with doing the work of multiple employees. sign a position contract that you will uphold those roles. as your doing these tasks, document the best way to do them. over time, you can figure things out and hire appropriate people (it's ok if they are beginners) for specific roles. 
- #4: your management strategy
	- if you have a good management system, you don't need good managers. the system makes most of the necessary decisions.
	- try to understand your customer preferences, and provide them with custom services based on your management system
- #5: your people strategy
	- you can't get your people to do what you want, you have to give them an environment in which doing it is more important than not doing it
	- don't overwork or exploit your employees, be nice and give them space; as long as they're following the rules of the system
	- "the work is a reflection of who we are inside. if we're sloppy, the work is too. if we're organized, the work is too." -- talk to your employees to motivate them about work
	- set the rules of the game correctly
		- create the game first, and fit your people into it (not the other way round)
		- never create a games you're unwilling to play yourself
		- make sure there are clear ways to win the game, value the victories
		- change the game from time to time
		- you need to keep reminding people of the game, show them violations
		- the game has to make sense. support the game by your logic.
		- the game needs to be fun time to time
		- feel free to steal other's games
- #6: your marketing strategy
	- see your customers an a robot who takes in information through sensors, and decides if he wants to buy at your stores. he makes predictable choices based on his subconscious motives. 
	- you can know more about your customer more than he know about himself by analysing his demographics and psychographics; make these analyses scientifically
	- make hypothesis about what craving the person is trying to fulfill with the purchase. use that analysis to sell more.
	- learn the customer language, and speak it clearly and well. 
	- use data to drive all decisions: shapes of logos, determining the promotions to run, etc. you can only do this if you have the space to think strategically instead of being an employee all the time.
- #7: your system strategy
	- three types of system: hard systems, soft systems and information systems
	- business plan is innovation, quantification, orchestrations, and integration of these systmes into your business.
	- use a hard system to resolve / make things easier for the soft system to follow
	- make sure all the plans in line, directed in the same direction.
- see this more like a lab, and run experiments. these principles will work, everytime. call for action! 

Ideas:
- This also applies to individuals. You need to come up with principles for your life, that whoever follows, will be able to accomplish the same success that you have.
