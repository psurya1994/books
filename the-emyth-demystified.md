Most small businesses are not started by entreprenuers, they are started by technicians. Often, they are working for someone, learn enough about the work, become the best technician at their work (and also enjoy doing the work), so they decide to start a business independently. 

They tend to continue to be technicians once they start their own business. They try to do everythign by themselves, all the admin + tech stuff. They start to realize that it's too much. They hire someone, who is also quite enthusiastic and helps them get things done. However, that person suddenly quits, leaving the company in doubt. So the person scales it back, and operates it alone. But he realizes that doing that doesn't give him the freedom that he wants from such a business. He dreads the work, and gives up on it. 

Why does this dynamic play out? It's because of the naive model of the person about the world of business. What does he not realize?

Being a small business owner is essentially switching between three roles: entreprenuer, manager and technician. A typical person who starts a business tries to be 70% technician, which is the cause of the problem. They need to keep higher focus on being an entreprenuer and manager. Focus on hiring and offloading stuff, instead of he himself taking up so many things.

Chapter 7: turn-key revolution
- McD was able to develop hamburger machines, so that human skill is not needed anymore. That's a game changer. If you can build your business in a way such that anyone can run, you make your life much easier. 
- Franchises are terminated <5% annually, compared to 80% failure rate of independent businesses. Business-format franchies (gives full system for the new franchies to build) are ground changing.
- McD built a systems-dependant business, so that anyone who uses those systems, things will work. Instead of people-dependant business. 
- Ray, the founder of McD, worked on it such that any idiot can run it with the rulebook. He thoughts like an engineer mass producing a enginer: what can go wrong and how can we avoid htat? 
- The consistency of McD is what makes it stand out. It's able to consistency produce things across so many franchises for 30 years, that a typical business owner fails to produce for an year. 
- McD is a great model that we can emulate. 

Chapter 8: the franchise prototype
- 75% of franchises succed in 5 years, 20% of standard small business succeed in 5 years. 
- How did McD acheieve that kind of consistnecy? Same same products, put through the same process for the exact same time. 
- Focus on building a business that's free of you. That's the best way to build a successful small business.

Chapter 9: working on your business, not in it
- your business is not your life. thr purpose of the business is to serve your life. 
- pretend that what you're building is a prototype for 5000 more just like it. understand that you have to provide consistent value to your customers; beyond what they expect.
- focus on building a system that can be operated by the lowest skilled workers. it shouldn't be dependent on one high skilled worker that you would hire.
- don't make a business that's dependent on the employees you hire. If you do, the productivity depends on the moods of people.
- this helps your resolve people problem.
- keep things orde
