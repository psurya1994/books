Introduction:
- Don't allow sadness to change your behavior, that will start the ruining of your life. Leads from a few days of misery to few months of bad life. 
- The time when we need to take the most care of ourselves is when we're the least likely to do so. 
- I felt mentally really good after my workout and meditation today, I'm hoping that this book will help me uncover why.

Chapter 1: 
- The anti-depressants that doctors prescribe work, you don't feel the lows, but the problems is that you also don't feel the highs. 
- People have "chronic cognitive and mood problems", this is because of imbalance in their brain chemicals: seratonin, dopamine and cortisol. Most people can be fixed with just simple practices. 
- Diet plays a vital role; even apparently healthy foods might not be good enough because of the changes in the food supply. 
- Doctors prescribe drugs to people before even trying natural alternatives. The potential side effects for these drugs can be disastrous. 
- Study: 2/3rd of people using anti-depressants were not clinically diagnosed with depression. 

Chapter 2:
- Why do you feel gloomy and uninspired in the mornings? Due to distractions, gym, multi tasking, unhealthy foods, etc.
- How can you fix it? By making sure our brain chemicals are controlled.
	- Dopamine: excitement, motivation, pleasure. lack of it makes us feel bored, and lose the general sense of life.  
	- Serotonin: calmness, serenity, optimism, self-confidence. lack of it makes us vulnerable to emotional and physcial pain.
	- Cortisol: used to fear us. imbalance makes you feel exhaused, hard to sleep, etc.
- I'm you're not feeling sharp, you need to fix your brain chemistry. Not amount of will power, environment setup, public commitments, etc., can help if your brain chemistry is off.
- What does your brain need? nutrients, vitamins, amino acids, healthy fats. exercise, consistent sleep, downtime, meanings, spirtuality, connection to something bigger than yourself.
- What fogs your brain: sugar, artifical sweetners, white flour, unhealthy fats, conventional meat, omega-6 omega-3 imbalance, caffine, alcohol, drygs, medication, over exposure to blue light, distractions, too much time doing unmeaningful activities: obligations / unnecessary entertainment.

Chapter 3: carbs
- Sugar is a constant in most items you buy: whole grain cereal, green juice, dark chocolate, reduced-fat peanut butter, granola bars (brown sugar), whole-wheat toast (whole wheat flour + high fructose corn syrup => no fiber and sam glycemic index as white bread)
- It's not good to have these sugary items in every meal.
- Blood sugar has a huge bearing on our brain chemistry. They're not only making us fat, but changing our brain chemistry: increasing risk of dementia. 
- Previous people thought high blood-sugar led to only obesity, cardiovascular disease, but studies recently showed that it leads to worse brain problems: dementia, alzheimers, serious brain fog, etc.
- We don't have a mechanistic view yet. Author's study: "anti-inflammatory foods sharpen brain, pro-inflammatory foods do the opposite"
- “Increasing the amount of anti-inflammatory foods in your diet may also help to prevent a condition known as leaky brain, in which pro-inflammatory molecules can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing all sorts of problems.”
- When we eat a lot of refined carbs, our body generates a lot of insulin which leads to type-2 diabetes. 
- Alzeheimers is just "type-3 diabetes" -- as it is cause by the exact same blood sugar spikes.
- folate, a type of vitamin B is essential for brain function. 
- low levels of vitamin b12 lead to alzheimers and depression. 
- high-GI foods make you feel good in the short term, but increase your insulin resistance.
- What if we just switch to artificial sweetners? diet-soda drinkers are more likely to be depressed than regular soda. Why? Artificial sweetners disrupt the level of good bacteria in the gut. This affects mood and cognition. Serotonin is produced in your gut, so by changing the gut bacteria, you're changing the amount of chemicals delivered to your brain.
- So what do we do? Cut back on simple carbs and sugars. Increase anti-inflammatory foodsin your diet such as vegetables, beans and fish.
	- Try sprouted or flourless bread, instead of whole or whole-wheat
	- Replace white rice / pasta with veggies + quinoa / sprouted barley
	- Replace white pasta with zucchini or shirataki noodles
- Complex carbs also have amino acids like tryptophan; that's enables seratonin to cross the blood brain barrier. 
- fiber has the capability to stop blood-sugar spikes.
- You can further reduce blood sugar spikes with:
	- cinnamon: anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant (sugar is inflammatory)
	- raw / slightly cooked veggies: cooking compromizes teh capabilities of fiber it contains
	- vinegar: prevents starch in bread / pasta from turning into sugar. get salad dressing that has vinegar and olive oil.
	- tea: reduces amoutn of glucose absorbed by the interstine
	- red wine: reduces livers production of glucose

Chapter 4: fats
- People eat far too many omega6 and not enough omega3. 
- Non organic grilled chicken gives you pro-inflammatory omega6s.
- Healthy fats: monosaturated oils (olive oil), omega3 fat found in fish. 
- People having healthy fats are 42% less likely to have cognitive impairment. 
- The nutrition facts don't tell you how much of the fat is pro-inflammatory omega6 and how much is anti-inflammatory omega3
- omega3s:
	- reduce depression, stress, anxiety. counter cancer, heart disease, arthiritis.
	- the body cannot make this on it's own, we need to go out of our way to get these fats in
	- three types: 
		- EPA (mood): helps counter depression, anxiety.
		- DHA (cognition): helps coutner dementia, higher IQ for babies
		- ALA: needs to be converted to DHA / EPA for the benefits, but our body is not good at this; so better to directly get DHA / EPA
	- lack of omega3's is one of the top factors for death
	- omega3 fish oil supplement is helpful (make sure they don't have oxidized lipids though)
	- if you want to have better mood, take 7:1 EPA to DHA supplements. 
- We need to manage the ratio of omega 3s to omega 6s. Modern food have a lot of omega6s.
- Upping omega3. Eat a lot of fish (but not tilapia which is high in o6, and not theones which have mercury). Mercury leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. 
- Black coffee / green tea can reduce mercury exposure by >50%.  
- olive oil is a healthy source of fat. unsaturated, polysaturated fat: unhealthy. monosaturated fat: healthy. olive oil is incredible for your brain, get more of it. use it intensively. protects from stroke, depression and cognitive impairment. 
- avoid soybean oil: has more polyunsaturated fat than mono unsaturated fat. 

Chapter 5: protien
- You need to use high quality protien to improve mood, and omega3 and omega6 aren't mentioned on the nutrition facts. 
- Non organic chicken breast is high in omega6 and low in omega3. Instead have organic chicken breast, wild salmon and walnuts.
- fat-free skim milk < low-fat organix milk -- leads to more omega 3s. it also provides fat soluble vitamin D.
- The labels don't tell us about: use of hormones / antibiotics / pesticides, type of feed, isoflavone content, amino acids content, how it is processed, etc.
- Soy: 
	- skip all normal soy projects and only get non-GMO and organic ones.
	- soybean oil has too many o6s.
	- non organic soy has the highest amount of pesticides
	- we do not know how GMO foods affect our long term health, so it's best to avoid them
	- soy protien isolate is not good.
- Meat:
	- It is very important to go organic. They have more o3s than o6s.
	- Factory raised meat are pumped iwth anti-biotics to keep them from infections in their poor environment.
	- Pick meats that say organic, grass-few, free-roaming, pastured. 
	- Note: we get o3[ala], which are not as good as o3[epa,dha] we get from fish.
	- Conventional meat also has PCBs and dioxins: industrial byproducts that contribute to cancer and neurologicla problems.
	- Reduce meat oxicity by: marinate before grill, flip frequently, eat it medium instead of well done
	- People who ate processed meats were 68% more likely to get pancreatic cancer.
- Diary:
	- Organic milk can increase omega3, vitaminD in your diet.
- Eggs:
	- Organic are far healthier: double o3s, more vitamins
	- Look for organic, free roaming, pastured; not all natural, cage-free or vegetarian fed
- Expenses:
	- Offest your grocery bill by reducing the amount of meat, diary and eggs in half. 
	- Increase intake of clean fish and sprouted bread
	- Whey protien which is organic / grass-fed is the best. 

Chapter 6: Mediterranean diet
- 7 servings of fruits and veggies: happier, less nervous, less depressed.
- Folate. Get it from vegetables: spinach, brussel sprouts, asparagus, brocolli, lentils, kidney beans
- B12. organic eggs and fish
- D. leads to depression / calcium deficiency. have salmon, or 15-20mins of sun exposure.
- Quinoa with veggies is the best type of food. 
- All vitamins are corelated, deficiency in one can affect all others. 
- VItamin pills are not good enough, because they don't have cofactors that are generated in our body of eating appropriate foods.
- Turmeric + pepper is important.

Chapter 7: 

Keywords:
- Insulin (hormone created by your pancrea) controls the amount of the glucose (blood-sugar) in your bloodstream at any time. It also helps store glucose in fat, liver and muscles. 
- The glycemic index gives an approximate measure of how much a carbohydrate in a food raises your body’s blood-glucose level.
	- <55: beans, small seeds, strawberries
	- 56-69: basmati rice, bananas
	- >70: white-rice, white bread, pasta, cookies, cake, candy
	- rolled oats: 55, instant oats: 79
- diabetes: type 1 diabetes is a genetic disorder that often shows up early in life, and type 2 is largely diet-related and develops over time. If you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system is attacking and destroying the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. they have a diverse range of symptoms. They need to get insulin shots.
