Introduction:
- Animals have automatic trigger patterns to specific and narrow stimuli in the environment.
- Humans have similar trigger patterns (which can be overridden by top down control though). People are more likely to oblige to your request if you use the word "because". 
- Human subsconscious stereotype: expensive = good, inexpensive = bad. Expensiveness of an item causes humans to have a big placebo effect.
- Humans respond with appropriate behaviors based on few key features / stereotypes.
- Humans generally take the words of experts unless they have skin in the game. 
- Another rule: people acts like their neighbors. This is exploited by using fake reviews on websites.
- Possible exploitations:
	- Items of discount in a store might be overpriced to sell them off quicker.
	- Sales people show you a higher priced item first, so that the lesser priced item will seem less expensive.
	- Once you agree to buy a car, people start suggesting more features that will incrementally make your car look better.

Chapter 2: Reciprocation
- People reciprocate irrespective of they like you or not. Just do something nice with seemingly no intent before asking a favor. 
- When someone does something nice, don't say "nah, it's no big deal". Say "if our roles were reversed, I'm sure you'd do the same for me" to trigger the reciprocation response.
- Matching our gift to the person's need amplifies the feelings of reciprocation.
- When someone buys you a drink before meeting, it's rude to refuse so you take it. But you're socially obliged to reciprocate now. 
- When someone does us a favor, we have an urge for action to help him; and in a much bigger way. We're doing it to get ourselves rid of the debt.  
- Evidence shows that rejection-then-retreat technique is a sustainable method, the victims don't feel exploited. It actually makes the victims feel better.
- How can we neutralize it's threat? If you recognize someone is using it, take what they give you and don't return the favor (define how the favors were being used as sales devices to free you of the guilt).
- Possible exploitations:
	- Giving a chocolate / small gift with bill increases the amount you'd tip.
	- Giving a ballon to kids that enter increase the likelihood of how much you'd spend. 
	- Any free gift given to you by a business is a possible way of exploitation. Be aware.
	- Tasting free samples at markets make you buy things you might not want. 
	- Don't take free gifts from people. You'll be tied to a social obligation to help them.
	- A kid asks you to donate 5$ to charity and when you decline, he asks you if you want to buy a 1$ chocolate. 

Chapter 3: Liking
- If someone we like tell us that a counter belief is correct, we're more likely to agree. 
- How to get people to like you? 
	- Physical attractiveness (in politics, job interviews, higher salary, persuasive, get more help)
	- Similarity (most likely to date) (in clothing, interests, name)
	- Mirroring (words, body movements)
	- Do favors
	- Compliments (be specific)
		- Works even if they know you need favors from them. 
		- Do it out loud to each person when you feel that. 
		- Especially on something that someone's insecure about.
		- Do it behind their back, to their assistants.
		- Do it when they do a good thing, and give them a great reputation for it. They will have this reputation to maintain. 
		- Tell them you want to learn from them. Give others the role of teachers.
	- Familiarity
		- just seeing someone before makes you like them
		- just saying the untrue thing again and again, you make normal people believe it.
		- shake hands
- If you don't like someone, it's more likely that we'll be disagreeable. 
- Everyone learns better in collaborative environments than rivalry environments. 
- Someone who carries bad news is associated with "badness", as if they caused it.
- Possible exploitations:
	- People never sue doctors they like. A doctor might be nice to you, while being engaged in malpractice so that you don't sue him.
	- Phone company offering discount for family for being on the same service. If someone pitches that you're going to save your friend some money by moving to this service, it's much more likely that you'll say yes. (referrals)
	- If someone claims to be similar to you, stay on guard. 
	- People who want more tips would exploit the above principles. 
	- "I heard you're really good at X, so I was wondering if you could help me with a project that involves X?"
	- Sales people telling that they will fight their bosses to get us a better deal.
	- Good cop bad cop routine.
	- Car next to a attractive model seems more attractive than just the car.
	- Having credit card logos in the place makes it more likely that you'll make a purchase.
	- An ad associated with something you know (eg. olympics) makes it much more likely that you'll get it
	- You're more likkely to enjoy an experience when you're eating plesant food.
