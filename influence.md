Introduction:
- Animals have automatic trigger patterns to specific and narrow stimuli in the environment.
- Humans have similar trigger patterns (which can be overridden by top down control though). People are more likely to oblige to your request if you use the word "because". 
- Human subsconscious stereotype: expensive = good, inexpensive = bad. Expensiveness of an item causes humans to have a big placebo effect.
- Humans respond with appropriate behaviors based on few key features / stereotypes.
- Humans generally take the words of experts unless they have skin in the game. 
- Another rule: people acts like their neighbors. This is exploited by using fake reviews on websites.
- Possible exploitations:
	- Items of discount in a store might be overpriced to sell them off quicker.
	- Sales people show you a higher priced item first, so that the lesser priced item will seem less expensive.
	- Once you agree to buy a car, people start suggesting more features that will incrementally make your car look better.

Chapter 2: Reciprocation
- People reciprocate irrespective of they like you or not. Just do something nice with seemingly no intent before asking a favor. 
- When someone does something nice, don't say "nah, it's no big deal". Say "if our roles were reversed, I'm sure you'd do the same for me" to trigger the reciprocation response.
- Matching our gift to the person's need amplifies the feelings of reciprocation.
- When someone buys you a drink before meeting, it's rude to refuse so you take it. But you're socially obliged to reciprocate now. 
- When someone does us a favor, we have an urge for action to help him; and in a much bigger way. We're doing it to get ourselves rid of the debt.  
- Possible exploitations:
	- Giving a chocolate / small gift with bill increases the amount you'd tip.
	- Giving a ballon to kids that enter increase the likelihood of how much you'd spend. 
	- Any free gift given to you by a business is a possible way of exploitation. Be aware.
	- Tasting free samples at markets make you buy things you might not want. 
	- Don't take free gifts from people. You'll be tied to a social obligation to help them.
	- A kid asks you to donate 5$ to charity and when you decline, he asks you if you want to buy a 1$ chocolate.
