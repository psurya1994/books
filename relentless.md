From the coach of all many top NBA players.

Chapter 1:
- Don't set any limits on yourself. You can do anything. Aim 10% higher of what you're already aiming for.
- Relentless: demand more of yourself than anyone else. 
- Don't stop to think. Just do all you can do, one moment after the other. 
- Anytime your mind says done, the first thing that needs to pop into your mind is "next?"
- Use your dark side to your advantage. 
- Don't compete with anyone else. Let them all compete with you.
- Focus on doing. Don't explain yourself to tohers.


My thoughts:
- Invest all the money you have into self growth. This is not the time to build savings.
