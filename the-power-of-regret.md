Chapter 1: nonsense of no regrets
- People like the idea of having no regrets. Many people get tattoo's that say "no regrets".
- General message from the society: forget and past, look into the future. So have no regrets! This message resonates with a lot of people.
- This world view is wrong. Regret is valuable because it can lift us up. This book provides you the tool to exploit the power of regret in your own life.

- When people say they have no regrets, they're not lying, but it's more of a self-delusion.
- We need positive emotions, but only focusing on them can inhibit growth and limit our potential. Negative emoitions are critical if we want to reach our potential.
- Research: regret makes us human, regret makes us better.

Chapter 2: regret makes us human
- Regret: the feeling associated with some action or inaction a person has taken which has led to a state of affaris that he or she wishes were difference
- kids below 8 haven't developed the mental capabilities for regret: time-travel and story telling (basically counter factual thinking)
- People who have damage to orbitofrontal cortex don't experience regrets: they don't have the mental capabilities.
- Feeling sad in the current moment is not regret. But it's regret if you board a time machine into the past, and tell contrasting stories of how her present could have been if she took different actions.
- Our brains are preprogrammed to regret.
- People generally regret 30% of the decision they make previous week.
- People who say who don't have regret, actually reframe regret into a learning experience.

Chapter 3: atleast and if only
- People with bronze medals are happier than people with silver medals. This is because of counterfactual thinking. (every extensively replicated study)
	- downward counterfactuals: how it could have been worse. "atleast I passed"
	- upward counterfactuals: how it could have been better. "if only I worked harder"
- "at least" delivered comfort and consolation, "if only" delivers discomfort and distress.
- 80% of the counter factuals generated are "if only" and 20% are "atleast"
- Thoughts about past that make are feel worse are much more common than the ones that make us feel better. [it's very interesting, I feel that this isn't true for me.]
- "if only" makes us feel worse today, but that regret helps us perform better tomorrow. 


Chapter 4: regret makes us better
- We often double down on things that don't work, because we've already invested in them (sunk cost fallacy)
- Study: increasing the feeling associated with "if only", improved future behavior
- Three benefits of regrets:
	- Sharpen decision making
		- When other people accept our offer without pushback, we regret not making a bolder offer. Feeling regret in those situtations can improve our decision making.
		- Study: people who have had their first offer accepted spent more time preparing in future negotiations.
		- Study: CEOs who spend time reflected on their regrets do better in future decisions.
	- Elevate performance
		- After a test, actively thinking about how you could've performed better ("if only") improves performance. It can deepen consistency and performance.
		- Even thinking about other people's regrets can lead to performance boosts. 
		- People with narrow misses at big events are likely to perform better in future because of the "if only" regret. 
	- Deepen meaningfulness
		- Regret with some actions in a relationship helps us be careful not to repeat those actions in future. 
- When we handle it well, regret actually makes us better.
- William James (father of psychology): "thinking is for doing" (answering the question of what's the purpose of thinking)
- But what about feelings?
	- Perspective 1: feeling is for ignoring
	- Perspective 2: feeling is for feeling
	- Perspective 3: feeling is for thinking
		- This is the most useful perspective. Confront your feelings, and use them as catalyst for future behavior. 
		- Occasional acute stress is helpful and essential.
- Framing a mistake as a character flaw is destructive. Framing it as a one-time behavior that can be changed is productive.
- See regret as a threat that helps you improve as a person.

Chapter 5: what do people regret?

Other thoguhts:
- A common regret people have is of not being bold enough, I shouldn't overcome that in my life.
- The author says the people who "do not have the ability" to regret, have brain damage. The author defines counter factual thinking as regret, not the negative feelings associated with that thinking. 

Summary:
- Regret is generally seen as a negative that is meant to be avoided in pop culter. But if we learn to handle it well, regret actually makes us better.
