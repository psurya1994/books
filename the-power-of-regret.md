Chapter 1: nonsense of no regrets
- People like the idea of having no regrets. Many people get tattoo's that say "no regrets".
- General message from the society: forget and past, look into the future. So have no regrets! This message resonates with a lot of people.
- This world view is wrong. Regret is valuable because it can lift us up. This book provides you the tool to exploit the power of regret in your own life.

- When people say they have no regrets, they're not lying, but it's more of a self-delusion.
- We need positive emotions, but only focusing on them can inhibit growth and limit our potential. Negative emoitions are critical if we want to reach our potential.
- Research: regret makes us human, regret makes us better.

Chapter 2: regret makes us human
- Regret: the feeling associated with some action or inaction a person has taken which has led to a state of affaris that he or she wishes were difference
- kids below 8 haven't developed the mental capabilities for regret: time-travel and story telling (basically counter factual thinking)
- People who have damage to orbitofrontal cortex don't experience regrets: they don't have the mental capabilities.
- Feeling sad in the current moment is not regret. But it's regret if you board a time machine into the past, and tell contrasting stories of how her present could have been if she took different actions.
- Our brains are preprogrammed to regret.
- People generally regret 30% of the decision they make previous week.
- People who say who don't have regret, actually reframe regret into a learning experience.

Chapter 3: atleast and if only
- People with bronze medals are happier than people with silver medals. This is because of counterfactual thinking. (every extensively replicated study)
	- downward counterfactuals: how it could have been worse. "atleast I passed"
	- upward counterfactuals: how it could have been better. "if only I worked harder"
- "at least" delivered comfort and consolation, "if only" delivers discomfort and distress.
- 80% of the counter factuals generated are "if only" and 20% are "atleast"
- Thoughts about past that make are feel worse are much more common than the ones that make us feel better. [it's very interesting, I feel that this isn't true for me.]
- "if only" makes us feel worse today, but that regret helps us perform better tomorrow. 


Chapter 4: regret makes us better
- We often double down on things that don't work, because we've already invested in them (sunk cost fallacy)
- Study: increasing the feeling associated with "if only", improved future behavior
- Three benefits of regrets:
	- Sharpen decision making
		- When other people accept our offer without pushback, we regret not making a bolder offer. Feeling regret in those situtations can improve our decision making.
		- Study: people who have had their first offer accepted spent more time preparing in future negotiations.
		- Study: CEOs who spend time reflected on their regrets do better in future decisions.
	- Elevate performance
		- After a test, actively thinking about how you could've performed better ("if only") improves performance. It can deepen consistency and performance.
		- Even thinking about other people's regrets can lead to performance boosts. 
		- People with narrow misses at big events are likely to perform better in future because of the "if only" regret. 
	- Deepen meaningfulness
		- Regret with some actions in a relationship helps us be careful not to repeat those actions in future. 
- When we handle it well, regret actually makes us better.
- William James (father of psychology): "thinking is for doing" (answering the question of what's the purpose of thinking)
- But what about feelings?
	- Perspective 1: feeling is for ignoring
	- Perspective 2: feeling is for feeling
	- Perspective 3: feeling is for thinking
		- This is the most useful perspective. Confront your feelings, and use them as catalyst for future behavior. 
		- Occasional acute stress is helpful and essential.
- Framing a mistake as a character flaw is destructive. Framing it as a one-time behavior that can be changed is productive.
- See regret as a threat that helps you improve as a person.

Chapter 5: what do people regret?
- Early research: Many people regret not getting enough education. But it had sampling bias. 
- New research: people have more diverse regrets.
- People regret things more when the opportunity has vanished.

Chapter 6: the four core regrets
- People regret not chasing them dreams, and settling for something mediocre. Not taking the risks.
- The deep structure of regret:
	- Foundation regrets
		- Failure to be responsible, conscientious or prudent. 
		- Failure to build a strong base / foundation for ourselves to build on top of.
		- Failure due to procrastination and lack of foresight.
		- eg. wasting time in school, and not having a good job now because of it
	- Boldness regrets
		- We're more likely to regret the chances we didn't take, than the ones we took.
		- Giving up the opportunity to try something new.
	- Moral regrets
		- Not standing up for the right thing / cheating.
	- Connection regrets
		- Not prioritizing the relationships in your life over other things. 

Chapter 7: Foundation regrets
- "if only I'd done the work": situations in which full consequences of the choices don't materialize immediately but they accrue over time, until they become too towering to deny.
- We overvalue now, and discount the future. This biases our thinking, which leads to poor consequences.
- Common regrets: not working harder at school, not saving enough money, not taking care of health
- Solution: act now (the best time to act was 20 years ago, but the second best time is now)
- dissapointments are outside your control, regrets are in your control

Chapter 8: Boldness regrets
- "if only I'd taken that risk"
- We decide to play it safe, and it relieves us at first, but the choice distresses us with a counterfactual in which we were more daring.
- People regret inactions more than actions in the long term. 
- Common regrest: being too introverted, not speaking up for myself, not asking someone out, not being bold ealier in career while caring about what other think, not starting a company earlier, not traveling when younger, not being true to yourself, etc.
- Solution: Speak up. Ask her out. Take that trip. Start the business. Step off the train.

Chapter 9: Moral regrets
- Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind: (i) we have visceral reactions for certain views, and then we come up with reasons justifying it (not the other way round), (ii) there's no absolute truth, it's people having different preference about what's right.
- Types of moral regrets:
	- Harm: hurting someone unprovoked (eg. bullying), not stopping harm to other people (eg. stopping bullying), insulting someone, 
	- Cheating: infedility (shattered trust)
	- Disloyalty: loyalty to group (not serving the country in military) 
	- Subversion: being disrespectful to someone who helps us
	- Desecration: abortion
- Smallest in number, but diverse in variety. 
- Common regrets: being unfaithful to partner, bullying, insulting, etc.
- Solution: when in doubt, do the right thing

Chapter 10: Connection regrets
- Letting go of old close relationships in life. Not having closure in relationships. Not calling and talking to an old friend when they're in need.
- These regrets affect more deeply than others. 
- Two types of relationship issues:
	- drifts: slow dissapearance
	- rifts: dramatic, sudden
- Being social, giving compliments are not awkward like we imagine, they generally lead to happiness and satisfaction. 
- Biggest study: "Happiness is love. That's all." -- Close relations keep people more happier than money or fame.
- <20 / 16,000 people regret having children.
- Solution: push past the awkwardness and reach out

Here's what I could potentially regret:
- Foundation regrets:
	- Not spending enough time learning about new deep learning techniques and implementing them. I might feel things once I become replacable by a new college grad who comes in with a much broader set of skills.
- Boldness regrets:
	- Not pushing hard enough on my ideas: making YouTube videos. Not learning BJJ.
	- Not telling my friend what I actually think about his decision to marry.
	- Compromising on my basic needs for others
- Moral regrets:
	- Not speaking up when someone is being bullied / insulted
- Connection regrets:
	- Not staying well connected to my family, my mom must be missing me. I need to talk to her more.

Cahtper 11: Opportunity and obligation 
- Regret structure:
	- Foundation regrets: people value stability
	- Boldness regerets: people value growth
	- Moral regrets: people value being good
	- Connection regrets: people value love
- So to live a positive life, we need: solid foundation, enough boldness, morality and meaningful connections. 
- Unpleasant feeling arise when there's a difference between who you are, and who you want to be. 
- Regret arises from ignoring opportunity or responsibilities. 
- We need to pick a life of opportunity and responsibilities. 

Chapter 12: Handling action regrets
- Steps: (eg. getting a tattoo, or slapping someone)
	- #1: undo it
		- people are more likely to fix action regrets than in action regrets because they're more easily reversible
		- undo by reaching out and fixing it
	- #2: at least it
		- recast how to think about it, see the positive from the experience (atleast you have nice kids even though you married a horrible person)
		- turns regret into relief
		- think about how it could have been worse

Chapter 13:
- use regret to do better in future. feeling is for thinking, and thinking is for doing.
- here's how you can improve you future:
	- #1: self-disclosure
		- disclose your thoughts to close friends (or atleast private in writing) >> thinking about those experiences
		- use emotions to think clearly (above helps us do then), then translate them into actions
	- #2: self-compassion
		- we treat ourselves more harshly than other people, don't do that. treat your mistakes, like you'd treat a friend who did them
		- understand that mistakes are a part of life and everyone makes them.
		- people writing with self-compassion are more likely to change their behavior
		- don't believe that they define who you are as a person. see it as a changable behavior
	- #3: self-distancing
		- look from the third person's perspective. distance yourself, and think as a third people and just see the dynamic that's unrolling there. 
		- see that this doesn't matter in the long-term
		- think as a doctor / clinical psychologist
		- career related regrets: if I was replaced tomorrow, what would my successor do?
- think about things you might possibly regret in future to avoid them now
	- have a failure resume, to get a sense of the kind of mistakes to you make to fail
	- pair regrets with resolutions

Chapter 14: anticipating regret
- "Live as if you were living for the second time and if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now." - Victor Frankl
- Anticipate things that we will regret and change your behavior in the current moment accordingly.
- When we envision how awful we might feel in future if we don't act appropriately now, that negative experice can improve our behavior.
- The downside:
	- We're bad at anticipating regrets: we overestimate how bad we will feel, and underestimate how well we will cope.
	- Anticipating regret might steer us away from the best decision, and to the deicison that minimizes regret the most. 
- Regret optimization framework:
	- We need to devote time to anticipate the four types of regrets: foundation, boldness, moral and connection.
	- Ignore other types of regrets: eg. buying lawn furniture or microwaves doesn't involve a fundamental enduring human need. 
	- Once you anticipate a regret, dwell on it futher. Choose the option that'd reduce this regret thinking back from future.
	- If we understand what we truly regret, we know what we truly value. 
	
Other thoguhts:
- A common regret people have is of not being bold enough, I shouldn't overcome that in my life.
- The author says the people who "do not have the ability" to regret, have brain damage. The author defines counter factual thinking as regret, not the negative feelings associated with that thinking. 
- Foundation regrets are something we can track every week and make progress on them. When I make mistakes on them, I cna share how I feel with Ramya and commit to a new behavior next time.

Summary:
- Regret is generally seen as a negative that is meant to be avoided in pop culter. But if we learn to handle it well, regret actually makes us better.
	- Study: Triggering regret in humans improves performance, decision making

Ideas: 
- I need to explore the input data more closely. Download and record games?
- Ask Ali: what do you think of the speed of progress?
