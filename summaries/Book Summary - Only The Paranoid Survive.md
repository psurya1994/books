Book Summary - Only The Paranoid Survive.md

The world, in the current age, changes rapidly due to technological innovation, financial crises, global disruptions, etc. These changes lead to inflection points: where the fundamental way of conducting business needs to change if you want to survive. This book covers a framework to think clearly and navigate such uncharted territories. 

What causes inflection points? 10x change in any of the 6 fundamental forces: competitors, customers, competitor's suppliers, potential competitors, complementors, different way to deliver service. When it happens, the actions that got you here don't work as expected anymore. You need to fundamentally change how you do business to be able to survive. 

Rules to handle inflection points:
- #1: make improvements in directions customers care about; don't just do them to look better on paper against your competitor. 
- #2: when a technology change comes your way, grab it immediately. time is everything, to gain the market before your customers. people who resist the new technology will lose inspite of their best efforts.
- #3: price for volume, what the market will bear, and deliver at that price. once you get the volume, you can start making profits.

Here are a few examples of inflection points, and how to handle them:
- You're a big player in the computer industry and the computing costs are going down by massively. You need to detect this trend early and start acting on it. For example, understand what avenue of new products this technology opens up, and start focusing your efforts there. So once you realize that there's actually an inflection point happening here, you'll have a product ready to deliver.
- You own a supermarket in a small town, and walmart enters the town. It is hard to compete with megacompetition in their own game. To survive, you should either specialize, or offer customize service or redefine your store as an environment instead of product.


How to detect inflection points early? 
- The first people to see this are the sales people and the middle managers, as they directly interact with the customers. Have an open line of communication with them, so that they can keep you aware of the industry trends. 
- Sometimes it's easy to judge (eg. FDA starts regulating the pharma industry), and sometimes it's hard (eg. consistent reduction in computing costs). In either case, it is important to run experiments when your company is healthy so that you're ready when the 10x change inevitably happens in a few years. 
- See if there are small competitors who do business differently, and have the potential to challenge you in a few years.

How can individuals handle inflection points?
The principles covered here not only affect businesses, but also individuals. Individuals are, in essence a business with one employee, competing against millions of other businesses to get work. 
Just like you company, you should respond to market forces, head off competitors, take advantage of complementors and be alert to different ways of doing business.
To succeed, be paranoid about your career. Feel fear. Keep track of the news to get a sense of the changes happening. Hear the conversations happening about the future of work in your field. 
Keep trying ideas on the side, to have other careers you can fall onto if this one doesn't work. Examples of experimentation: moonlighting on second job, going to school, asking your employer for a very different assignment, etc. Look for a job that takes advantage of the changes
Ask quesitons: What do you think the nature of your industry is going to be in two or three years? Is this an industry you want to be a part of? Is your employer in a good position to succeed in this industry? What skills do you need to progress in your career in this new landscape?
